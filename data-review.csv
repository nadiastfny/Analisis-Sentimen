I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c
I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!
This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!
I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.
I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.
"I'm 5""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath."
Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back.
More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid
"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees."
This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn't. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy!
Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you.
Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.
A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.
I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.
"If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. 

fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. 

the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting."
I'm upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!"
Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress, i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!
"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans"
I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
The colors weren't what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn't find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn't for me, in the end.
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....
This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.
I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer
These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.
"I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back."
This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!
Wouldn't have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!!
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos."
This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!
"First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot"
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!"
I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top.
This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.
Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.
This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it's comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it.
"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops."
Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun
Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i'm picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn't look great on me. there's a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it's a lightweight tee fabric that's opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend.
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.
I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)
This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.
3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.
Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!
Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i'm usually a l, but sometimes i'm a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i'm sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could've gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me
Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!
I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...
I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.
"This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style."
"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs"
I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit.
The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that.
I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.
This dress is adorable - it's a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it's dry clean...totally doesn't make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :(
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte"
I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli
"I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-) 
te blue is a light blue, almost neutral, with the white embroidery, i think it looked stylish, and decided to keep it. the peplum part hit just in the right spot, i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size..."
"I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser didn't look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5'1.5"". (115 lbs, 03 dd che"
Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
"I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;)"
This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was. i love the shape, design, and and the color. it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants. unfortunately, i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way. so far, it doesn't work with any of my jeans, skirts, or shorts. i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits, so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not. with that aside, it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful
"Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.
it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.
love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.
also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.
with various necklaces this top has limitless options!
the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.
would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f"
I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.
At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso.
I find that this brand can be a little bit all-over-the-place with sizes. had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m. despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well. i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this. just something to keep in mind. still a great shirt, love the neutral color.
"I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude."
Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.
I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca"
"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)"
"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!"
"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to"
This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style.
"Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i'm 5'4"", 120#, 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff."
"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!"
"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned."
"Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.

however, i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel"
"It's ok, fit doesn't wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it's comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 an"
In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t.
I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.
"Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it's a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.

if only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied)."
I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer
I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh
The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.
Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!
"My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off, it is scratchy"", so i didn't bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.
fit was true to size."
"The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!

Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side, but for me, it was big,,, too bad the smaller size is sold out (well, all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long, below the knee, but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists, adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!
I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight
This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.
"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely."
Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!
Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i'm usually a 10, but still a little snug.
Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.
This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.
So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.
I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did !
This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .
Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it's real leather.
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo"
My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami's in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the 'faux-fur cardi' in the ivory to wear over this top. it's a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.
I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn't sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. it's a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.
"I ordered this in xs, i'm 5'4"", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i'd buy more!"
"I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend. they were so comfortable and flattering, friends told me i could wear them out for dinner.

the fabric is beautiful, and i loved the way they draped. the angled cut on the legs is very cute, and something a bit different. these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner, because the fabric is very light and breezy. dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and you're good to go."
Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater, if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5'7, 34c, and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer!
This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.
Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that'll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra.
"Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3""). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy."
The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is
Loved the green color, the cut is super flattering, but alas, i do need hte petite, ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely, the color is sold out in petite :-(
"But i thought this was lace or with texture, it is more a pattern on regular fabric.

colors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don't think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don't want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-)"
"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right."
Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist.
Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.
I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fall/winter. i love the color. it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up.
This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.
"Just came today: the print is gorgeous.  very bohemian. it's a dressier dress with the chiffon.  on the con side, the chiffon is very delicate, snagged easily while trying on. there's raw edges on the waistband, needed trimming fresh out of the package.  sz 10 fit in the waist, too small for 36d bust; sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist.  sz 10 ankle length for 5'7"", 12 hits the floor.  haven't decided if i'll keep the 12 and try to alter."
"My waist measures 28"" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it's machine washable, and the quality looks good."
I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.)
I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!"
"I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces). 

unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the"
"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good."
For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!
This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned.
Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.
"I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love, the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine
appeal. while the material was not v"
"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. 34 d. i bought the medium. i think i could have gotten the small but i didn't have time to re-order. it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half. i love the length and the fabric.!"
The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
"Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight, especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered, size up.  it has a dreadful side zip, is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p, my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#."
Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.
Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i'm not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd 'smoky'-like odor, but it's the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr
This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care.
Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.
"I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.

my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5'3"") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for"
This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.
"So i love pilcro, i wear them all the time and usually size down because they ""grow"" after wearing them. i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight, not sure if they will get any looser. the material feels really good, lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute. not sure if i'll keep them or maybe size up,"
This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses
Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple, but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom, can't even gegt them hemmed, what a bummer. my inseam is 27 inchess, so i would need a 5 inch heel. otherwise, gorgeous, and waiat fits true to size. thighs a bit snug for musclea, but stretchy enough to fit. thinking about keeping them, but have to find big plaform heeks...
"I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)

cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.

color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.

ruffle is a great addition too..."
"I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.
the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top."
"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it."
These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size."
"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!"
"I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees.
cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?"
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.
Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!
Ordered these online and they fit perfectly. i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed. the striped pattern is cute and adds some color.
I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget
I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!
Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however!
This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn't see online. they are super pretty in person.
"I tried these on in the store, and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)"
"Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it's just right; i wouldn't be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat."
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!
I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.
I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!
Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down!
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w"
"This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i'm typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely."
Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.
I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!
This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.
I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn't seem to be a woman's white t on the planet that isn't these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don't mind the sheerness it's worth the gambl
This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!
I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price.
I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on"
"Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.

a must have for the summer!!!!!!"
"Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the ""2"" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!"
I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable
Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace.
"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size"
The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.
"I liked this top even though it was a definite 'swing' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.
looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer."
I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.
Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.
I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.
I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo
"I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!
it is an absolute must-have!"
I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!
This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down
I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a
First i ordered a m. i'm normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy.
"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier."
This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.
Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress
True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!
I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!
"I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small."
"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3""). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)"
"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked."
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.
This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.
"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets."
"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!"
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p"
Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.
I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short
"This dress has potential, but it didn't work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5'9""). the reason i'm not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit,"
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.
"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily."
This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.
My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.
I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need
When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.
Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.
I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!
"I am 5.6"", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous"
"This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it."
"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material."
"Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i'm 5'8"", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn't crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great!"
"I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer."
Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.
I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.
"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik"
Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.
"I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don't like polyester; still, i couldn't pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it's like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it's a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i"
I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.
"This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn't make it work
."
"I love the sweatshirt 
 clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges 
 although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite
 great light sweatshirt for spring and summer"
"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!"
Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt.
I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor
"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic."
I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent
This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!
"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the"
"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not"
The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!
I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item.
An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!
This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!
I've been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while, and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves, worn long, are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn't exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used, but pretty nonetheless. i'm 5'5 /125 and th
Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size, even for an oversized piece. order a size down, even if you want a boxier look. unsure how the fabric will hold up-but if it does it will be a great get.
This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn't of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter.
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.
I love this top, it's design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i'm usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!!
This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a
"This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7"" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and"
"I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!"
I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.
Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and
"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos."
If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
"Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress. 

that being said, it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50's style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however, because it is a fulle"
I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.
"I'm surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it's completely different then how it looks on the model. it's much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it's my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material
is very nice and it's well made, but it's going back."
This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!"
"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you"
The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.
"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!"
I really wanted this dress to work out, but i was slightly disappointed in the fabric for the sleeves. the fit was accurate. i'm 5'7 and ordered a 6, however, my husband said it looked too little girl like. i did end up returning it :(
I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor
The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.
I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice, but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.
This is my first pair of mcguire jeans, and i like the fabric and fit.  thank goodness for petite sizing!  these 32p fit just right on my hips, with no gap between the waistband and my body.  fits through thigh and hips and pretty slim all the way down.  nice stretch.  of course, the proof will be after wearing a few times and washing.  i will update my review if i do not like them so much after that,
Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.
I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w
"I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5"" tall, 125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence."
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!
"I got he green color with gray accent stitching, looks awesome with gray tone leggings. super soft, definitely runs a little big (5'6"" 140 lbs i ordered the small) but not in an unflattering way."
Love this tunic, it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots
"I thought this dress was worth reviewing since my opinion differs from many others.
i agree that the fabric is quite thin compared to what you may be used to with byron lars dresses, but the flattering fit and quality (has a nice built in slip) i found to be what you may expect from the brand. if you go in thinking it's more of a spring/summer dress, you will not be disappointed.
however, i find the sizing to be slightly off. i usually wear a 2p (i'm 5'2""), or a 0 regular.
i ordered several size"
I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i
I love byron lars dresses, and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty, and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is, sadly, going back today.
"Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small."
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and due to the ""slim fit,"" i ordered a size up -- a 2 petite up from my normal 0 petite. when i received it, i was surprised about two things: 1) the material was kind of puffy (not bad, just weird), and 2) it was too big on top - rare for a petite size - even though it fit everywhere else. i wanted to love it, but had to return. would be gorgeous for someone else!"
I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!
I got this shirt in the mail today and was really excited to try it on. other reviewers said that it ran large so i ordered a size down and it fit perfect. i looked in the mirror and noticed the ruffles were misaligned and obviously so. i want to exchange it in the store but seeing that the size is not longer available online, i'm not really sure i'll find another one in my size.
I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.
I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o
"I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily."
"I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i didn't want to risk showing any skin at work. 

the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. 

being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find"
"I just tried this top in red in xs and i think it's cute. it's fairly fitted in my opinion; the sleeves are pretty snug but there's stretch to them. i was fine with the fabric and the size xs (i'm ~105 lbs, 34aa) even though sometimes i fit better in xspetite. the only downside is that the washing instructions say to remove the tie before machine washing, and i guess that put me off a little (the idea of re-lacing it every time). so i haven't yet bought it. the red is vibrant, tomato red and the"
"5'6"" 113lbs purchased size small in rich navy. so soft and comfy and i like that the cuffs help the pants not ride (even during sleep). i like that the fit is slim but not constricting on legs as all my yoga pants. tested this at my local vinyasa class and it held up without making me too hot (and i sweat a lot).

my biggest complaint is that the fabric pills right out of the packaging. actually their tag says the fabric does this and over time will continue to do this more and more because of i"
Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.
"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2"", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit."
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.
"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on, but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4, hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly."
I really like this top. it's super cute - perfect for a football game or fairly casual event. the material is ribbed and is thick enough that you can't see through. i purchased this top in red and initially in petite but ended up returning it for the regular size. i love this top!
Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.
Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
"Very nice casual, inexpensive shirt and the laced neckline is great....not too revealing and easily worn tied 
without looking prudish. and of course, open as well"
When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!
I really like how this looks on the model, but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work, but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it, a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so, best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun, distinctive new shift dress. got it, tried it on, took it off, went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image, but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl"
This vest is very warm and soft. it is actually a fleece that almost appears as wool. the plaid is beautiful-a pretty soft pink with the black and charcoal colors. i ordered a size large and the fit is okay. an xl would have been too big under the arms and in the bust area however, i would have liked it a little looser in the bottom half. i kept the large as there is no closure to the vest. it just hangs open.
"I love this shirt so much that i've now bought it in 2 colors -- the olive green and the red. probably would have bought it in black too if i didn't already have enough black shirts. it's both a plain and simple tee, but with the fun lace-up detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boring.

it runs true to size but is very fitted. however, due to the thickness of the material, i didn't feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted, despite how close the shirt fit to my"
Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.
I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.
"I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice."
"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend."
I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.
"Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a ""fat stage""...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good."
This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!
"I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction."
It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.
This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!
"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and"
Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.
"This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.
it looks and feels like really good quality."
This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!
When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package, and i should have noticed and returned it, but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well, it wasn't, and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.
I simply love this jacket. it's comfortable, soft and has a relaxed fit that is easy to wear. i wish i had bought mine while it was on sale.
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.
This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.
"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is"
"I bought this in the white, size m (140lbs., 5'8"", 34b) because i wanted a baggy fit, which i got, so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white, which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size, this tee nips in at the waist.however, the quality of this tee is lacking, as it is the typical, cheap, marled, slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th"
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening
"I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3"" about 124 lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth"
"Bought this in an xs and i liked the style of the skirt. it was long enough to wear to work. 
however the waist was too large and would not stay up on my waist. returned."
"I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend ""cold shoulder"" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo"
Nice fabric, very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...
I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!
Soft cotton in very stylish yet simple style. regrettably, i listened to reviews that said it ran tts and ended up w a baggy long one that won't work even if i shrink it. that will teach me-- always order multiple sizes!
I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!
"This top reminds me of the special tops i got ""once upon a time""...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement."
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!
"I love the layered look of this jacket. i got it in navy which matches everything. i think it's a little on the large side for me. i ordered a small. i'm 5'2"" 130 lbs. super comfortable. the inner layer is very soft. once you wash it, the outside is soft too. i've already worn mine several times. happy."
"I really wanted to love this dress, but it was so short! i'm only 5'6"" so i don't consider myself really tall, but the dress only came a couple of inches lower than my butt! way too short for me. my husband asked if it was a shirt or dress haha. but i think this would look adorable on someone a few inches shorter. or someone younger who can pull of a short shirt :)"
Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.
The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.
I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d
"This is a pretty top that is conservative enough for the office, with a modest neckline. there is a little hidden snap or button under the bow at the neck so you don't have to keep fussing with the tie the fit is loose in the waist and high at the neck, so the sheer parts are the only thing to give it a little flirtiness. there is a matching camisole underneath that snaps in at the shoulders. overall, i thought it was nice when i tried it at the store, but it didn't have enough extra ""wow"" to ge"
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.
"Is not a place i want to be, even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes, this sweater is very cropped, but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance."
The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou
This dress is really cute in person. however, it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot, but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa
Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!
This knit dress is very comfortable. i liked the various colors used in the stripes. my only issue with it, is that the skirt of the dress flares out oddly and is quite short. in my opinion, this dress, with its sturdy fabric and long sleeves, would appear more proportional with a longer skirt. skirt length, along with horizontal stripes just did not work for me. regrettably, i sent it back.
Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.
This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!
"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.
also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.
too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking."
"Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3"" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric."
I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.
"Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe"
Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the
Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft, easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket, can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus."
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.
Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.
This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
"I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality."
This top is great for spring- it's super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what you're wearing it for. fits true to size and is great quality.
I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin
"This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often!
looks good with navy tights too!"
Based on some reviews i decided to get the regular xs, even tho i am an xs petite (5'2, 107 lb, 32c) i found the fit to be flattering -- fitted enough but not too loose or tight. the length is perfect and work appropriate, and the material has some weight to it. the grey one is colorful and cute. the only problem is the bagginess of the arms -- very unflattering. if i push the sleeves up, it hides the bagginess a little, but i would like to have the option to wear the dress with long sleeves., s
I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.
This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.
I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3"", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg"
"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!"
This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.
"I thought that it looked like it belonged on a 15 year-old. i can almost see why they styled the model in what looks like ankle socks....ready for cheerleading. for reference it fits true to size, but is very short. i am 5'2"" and tried on a regular small - it was at least 5 inches above my knee."
Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back.
I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th
"Wow the mixed reviews on this dress would make someone not get it at all.
it is true to size. i'm a 6 and the six fit as a glove on me.
the material is not at all stiff. i actually wished it was a bit more structured. but that didn't bother me.
i was able to close the zipper by myself.
i'm 5'7"" 144lb 36a.
the top feels confortable to me as well. i don't considered myself curve like jlo but i have hips. the dress does not make me feel bigger at all.
the only down side is that it looks more expens"
A nice alternative to jeans, good fit. i like the casual but edgy rocker look they have. will look good with booties and full length boots. i took the same size that i do in all pilcro pants.
I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.
This is a very cute and unique top!! i absolutely love the back, which makes up for my indifference of the front. i'm a little heavier in the middle, so it hides it a bit, but the light blue from the back that shows on the sides makes me feel a little wider. it's not perfect, but i like it enough to keep it. i got lots of compliments on it when i wore it. it's very comfortable too. i just wish the front had a little more to it or was a tad longer. overall very happy.
This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...
Great pants, like the edginess of the design in the material. kinda rocker like. soft material that's stretchy and hopefully will hold its shape during the day. the color is listed as black but it's more of a dark gray with a slight blue hint.
"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit"
This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.
The material is very soft and it looks just like it does on the model with the exception that it gets a little wrinkly at the hem and turns up at the corners. i like it and have already worn it a few times.
Was drawn to this dress in the store. my location had it displayed well (one mannequin with the dress & a jean jacket...another with the faux fur cardigan). the dress is a very vibrant red. but the fit is not for me. i am busty (34c) with a short torso, and the dress made me look like dolly pardon on top. but there was a lot of room on the bottom. i tried on a size 6 and felt like i needed a size larger on the top and a size smaller on the bottom. having said that, the material is a very good qu
I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.
The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.
Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
I love the color and the style, however it doesn't look as well as the model as i don't have a small waist like the model does. still overall, i love this dress and it is well made and comfortable
Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li
"I am 5'3"" 130 and curvy and this dress fit me perfectly. it's great for parties and weddings (depending on how formal). the only reason i gave it four stars is because the fabric is a little strange; the ribbing for the squares is almost like a pillowy fabric, and it feels a little bit on the cheaper side but luckily it doesn't look cheap. nonetheless, i love this dress and would definitely recommend!"
"Love this dress! just wore it last night to an early valentine's dinner. very classy, simple, but gorgeous. i'm a size 2 in just about everything but i always buy a size 4 in retailer dresses because i'm tall (5'9"") and have broad shoulders and a long torso, and sizing up in dresses works better all around. i am also not busty (32b). i did get this in a 4. this dress was a little awkward at first trying to hook and then zip but once i got that down it worked. the hook is right up under your"
Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.
the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r"
This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning, the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect.
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.
Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.
This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!
"I am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner."
Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.
I saw this online and thought, hmm, no. then saw it in the store, touched it, and the fabric felt so soft. i am normally an 8 petite in cartonnier, but the only sizes available were 4 and 2 regulars in-store. the 4 just looked promising. i thought i'd try it on for laughs. but it is soooo cute i ended up taking it home. the 4 regular fits perfectly on my curvy on the bottom, 5'2, 145 lb figure. my measurements are 34(b)-29-38, and i was shocked how well this fits in a 4 regular! perfect length a
Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.
"I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3"" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has"
These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!
"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect."
First, my husband had to help me zip up in this interesting but awkward design. the materials is nice, but stiff, so the skirt is quite full. the shoulder idea is interesting, but i would not want to spend an evening in it. to me, not up to the usual ms standard.
"This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1"", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28"" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25"" long, but it's actually just about 24"". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)"
These pants are so soft and so comfortable! i was absolutely in love at first sight. however, i got the petite, because i am 5'3, and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be. i wanted them to hit right above the ankle, just like the photo, however, they are a tad longer. i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever, so i am gonna deal with the length!!
I just tried on this dress in the store, in red, and i loved the off the shoulder design. the color is just as pictured online (a light poppy red). the neckline began a few inches below my collarbone and was super flattering. however, the skirt portion of this dress flared awkwardly at the hips, causing my hips to look much wider than they really are (and also disturbing the otherwise clean lines of the dress). it seemed to me that there was too much fabric at the back portion of the skirt than
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt
I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.
"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product."
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular."
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
"Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)"
This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.
The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.
This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.
"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift."
"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small."
This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress, the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags, etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.
These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!
I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.
"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit."
I got the shorts and the blue motif they're really comfortable and will look cute with a tank top for the weekend.   they true to size them usually a size 4 to 6 and i got a small and that works.
I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!
This is a great pant to wear to business and when you just need something more than a jean. not so skinny a 50+ woman can wear comfortably..
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!"
"I got this to wear as a beach cover-up over bathing suits. if you purchased a darker color and were small chested (i.e., you could go braless, since a bra won't work well with the low back and armholes), you might be able to pull this off as a very casual dress. i bought this in a xs in the coral/peach (i'm 5'7"", 129 lbs., 32dd) and it's not super see-through, but i'd never be comfortable wearing it as a dress on its own. as a beach cover-up it's cute and comfortable, but as a dress it would be"
This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!
This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d
Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.
"I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6"",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go"
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!
I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th
"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti"
This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!
I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!
"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads."
Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.
I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.
"Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the
quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs"
This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.
Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support.
This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.
I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern, so hopefully will work for others!
"These are really cute. nice fabric. i love the rise...not to low, not too high. but they are going back. i'm a size 4. i got these in a 4. they fit fine in the waist and bum but they are tight around my calves. also, they were more like ""high waters"" on me than cropped so a petite in the length probably would have worked better for me had these fit."
"Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a ""i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice"" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up."
These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).
I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o
"The material and construction of the pants are great, but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles, and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine, or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants, but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4"", 125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips."
I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!
I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.
"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying."
This cardigan is very cute in the picture and i really wanted to love it but it just didn't seem worth the price. the material is kind of itchy to me and i wasn't a huge fan of the wide edges in the front. the colour is very nice and feminine.
I never buy anything at retailer full price, but had to get this when i tried it at my local store, especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering, and super comfortable. fully lined, not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out, or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics, i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low, but on me that is not the case. the t
This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.
I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!
Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.
I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small
These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!
After reviewing the comments for this dress i was really hesitant about buying it online, so i finally went to the store and all of the reviews are 100% true. this dress is amazing in terms of quality, but the sizing makes zero sense. i'm normally a size 12, but based on the reviews i initially tried on a medium. even that was huge, arm holes so long you could see my entire bra. so i tried on the small and that fit perfectly. unfortunately, unless you're normally an 8(maybe) or above in sizing,
Loved the style, ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders, boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy, fitted business slacks. midday, i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say, it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i
"I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more"
I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts.
Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.
"I think the model is wearing a larger size, per the first review. i am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap, since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it."
I ordered the white solid & the white w/blue stripes versions in size xl. both fit me true to size. the fit matches the model's photos. i got these on sale and they're worth that price. they're great basics to have. the white/blue striped one is my favorite. it such a pretty combo. i love the unique neckline too. fun details for a basic tee.
"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!"
The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top, lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for, and while i'm only around a b
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.
The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.
Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks"
These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.
I took this sweater on a recent vacation up north. i wore it 3 evenings because the weather changed from hot to cool. loved the feel of being wrapped in a warm blanket. cocoon cardigan is an apt name. wasn't sure about pink but it is exactly as pictured. this will become a go-to in my sweater wardrobe.
"I normally wear a size 2 so i ordered a small and an small petite, i will be keeping the small because the small petite looks like a shirt on me, my height is 5'4"". it runs very big underneath the arms as well. the design is so unique i will be keeping it."
"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large, and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy,"" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous, but a thin camisol"
"I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5"" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it."
The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier.
I received this sweater in last week, when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy , it is not , the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value.
I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i
I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)
This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.
"This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though"
I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!"
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove."
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.
This is a cool relaxed style with the benefit of an open neckline to add a bit of femininity. i tried on the faded blue and striped colors in the store. the faded blue goes well with the style, but the stripe is cute too. the sleeves are quite long and too tight to roll up, so if you are petite like me you will definitely want to order the petite size- and probably even those you who are in between petites and regular sizes. the sleeves may also be too narrow for some people.
This is a very pretty dress and looks just as it's pictured.  however, there is a lot of fabric - the lower half is very full and runs very large.
I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't, it is very heavy, much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice, the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance, easily. back it went, boo hoo. if you are between sizes, i would size down, runs a bit big.
I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love. it's a great summer / fall dress. i love the sweater top and linen bottom. so many compliments on it!
Absolutely in love with this shirt. the neckline is extremely flattering, and the shirt naturally comes away from the body.
I needed a tee refresher, i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo, and i'm not disappointed. the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace. the tee holds shape after washing and drying. my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model. the white has a cream tinge to it and i'm able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent. there is a cute little button detail at th
The fabric and detailing of this dress is of superior quality, but unfortunately it runs huge-- you definitely need to wear a tank or cami underneath. i am 5'9 145lbs with massive shoulders/smaller bust and i got the xs petite!
I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online, but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup, i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight, the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fianc was not a fan of the suit either. even
I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured. i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric. super cute with a grey top, white skinnys and brown leather sandals. love it!
This runs small, i got the size 3 which fits like a medium, not a large. its a bit of an aline shaped knit in a beautiful saturated navy. i loved the elbow length sleeves. i have a large 34g bust and although this fit, it came to the top of my waist and i'm short-waisted. it's a great basic for someone less busty or who likes a shorter length.
Very soft and comfy tee. like the interesting neckline. wish the petite neckline was slightly higher, but sleeves are right length and have great cuffs.
"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks.."
Love the color, but the fit is just odd and frumpy. the sleeves are shorter than the should be. when i lift my arms, the entire sweater gets lifted. going back.
Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.
"I love the way this t-shirt fits. the horseshoe opening in front is deep enough to add interest, but not too revealing. will look great with layered, dainty necklaces. the sleeves are nice and long - and i have long arms. the length of the shirt itself could be an inch or two longer, but overall the design is nice. not too tight, not too loose. i'm 5' 5"" and 125 lbs - 34c and the small fits me well. fabric is medium weight - could be a little thicker. the brick color is nice and works great with"
This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.
The blue is a very flattering color. the fit is not. it does not lay in the back like in the photo on the model. instead, there is a lot of fabric that falls in horizontal folds because it does not fall straight because the sides at the bottom are narrower than the mid section. i think i'm going to return it. the neckline is very nice and faltering. the sleeve at the wrist is kind of constricting, though, and long. it doesn't run big at the chest section, just the mid section, then tapers in at
This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.
I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere
Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!
This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!
"I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.
did not look at good as the beige."
"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back."
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.
I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.
I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.
The sweater is cute, but scratchy.
It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
"I am on the fence about this dress, as you'll see the reasons below, but it is really breathable fabric and extremely comfortable!
_________
pros:
- tons of stretch to the top part. i'm a 36c, so a lot of retailer tops are too snug for women with some bust. however, i fit into a medium here without it being too snug. you could actually go down or up depending on how loose or tight you'd like it to be on you.
- the bottom half, the skirt, feels so nice on the skin. very breezy. it is layered an"
I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!
I am a curvy woman and leggings are new to my world. i am sorry that i did not discover these leggings sooner because they are lovely. they are comfortable and cozy with a great fit. i am 150 lbs and 5'7 and the m/l fit perfectly. i have the black and plum colors. great purchase!
"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. 
obviously, based off the"
This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!
The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.
The detail on this dress is lovely -- it's unusual and well-made from soft fabric. it is big though -- i would usually wear a medium and ordered a petite small. to give you a sense of how large it is, i am currently 33 weeks pregnant, and bought this to wear after the pregnancy. i can actually get it on now, over the considerable baby bump. it doesn't look good, but i can in fact get it on. hoping it won't be way too large post-pregnancy, but it seems to fit fine in the shoulders now. definitely
This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back.
I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o
"This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you ""fold"" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur"
This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
"I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.

this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch."
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us"
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!
I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try, but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8, smaller on top, and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also, the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.
I loved this in the store, but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.
I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall
Haha, the unifying theme in these reviews seems to be don't trust the picture! i was misled by the neckline, i thought i saw a structured kind of asian-inspired mockneck/funnel thing and instead the top has a foldover cowl which, with my full bust underneath it, refuses to pose as a mockneck for me. overall there isn't much structure here at all. but the print is beautiful and the sweater cozy without being itchy.
"Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5""130lbs  and 32dd."
Has quickly become one of my 'go to' tops. comfortable, cute, looks just like the picture.
It is the perfect top to wear in the summer, it is nice and you can be somewhat dressy or super casual. i don't like anything too tight around my stomach and this has a nice flow with just the right amount of material.
This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also, the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath, it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you, buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.
I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore
I ordered size large and find it too boxy and long. love the hem, although the top is too long in this size so it's a bit hard to judge how it'll look in the right size. the sleeves are cute and different, a bit wide and flowing. be warned, it's sheer which is more apparent from the side view. i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem. has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size.
"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
"I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. 

second, the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been"
"Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1"" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for"
This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!
I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium.
"This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. 
this dress is a keeper!"
Very attractive and easy to wear. i wore it the night it arrived and wore it again the next night! i love the colors, the pattern and design. this is a stylish tunic sweater. the sleeves are not full length, which i prefer. the sweater is dense - the weave is tight, making the sweater quite warm, but not too warm.
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.
"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami. 
my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin"
"Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3"" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer."
As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.
I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.
"Very slimming, lovely dress.
a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.
the embroidery is lovely, fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly. 
so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!"
New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love
This sweater looks soft and flowy on the model, but in the store it is rather stiff lace in the back and very plain in the front. i did not like the ribbing on the front bottom of the sweater because it pulled in places and didn't lie flat. way too expensive for what you are getting.
Again, bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink, and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess, mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home, and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child, this one's going back!
I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
I was on the fence about this jumpsuit at first.  i feel the pockets in the back are a little high on my bum.  kind of an unnatural placement.  i sized up so it wasn't so tight fitting at the waist and hips so it made the placement of the back pockets a little better.
Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size, the fabric has very little give but is comfortable.
This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7), it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.
After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!
"I tried this tunic on in my local retailer store. they do not carry petites, so i tried on a regular small (i'm 5'2"", 130lb). the proportions were a bit off. the v-neck fell way too low and there was extra material puckering across the bodice. i definitely think a petite would work better for my height. alas, no petites in-store or online in the color(s) i would purchase. i didn't find the shirt too thin, as some have commented. it's essentially a midweight t-shirt material (but rayon, so beware o"
"Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too. 

i ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis"
I do think the fabric could be a little more substantial for the price, and was disappoitned that even petites, were again, too long... the color is nice enough (neutral), and they definitely look like work pants. they are true to sice, but i could do the low end of my size range.
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.
After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on, it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it, but i knew i would not wear it so, unfortunately, it went back.
I ordered the green, black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition.
I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.
"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4"", 36c, 145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it, but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too"
This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.
I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.
This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.
"You guys, i love this so much! however, within one hour of wearing it, the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!"
"I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!"
I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.
"Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too ""baggy"" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!"
"I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha"
Love the design and the gold color, but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
Great style!
"This top is great - lightweight and flattering.
i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. 
i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much."
"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me."
The fabric is beautiful, even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large, as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure, even though it's a lapel, and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs, and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad, as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.
Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.
"Great material. a bit loose in the middle / lower half. doesn't belt well. it could be 3"" shorter, considering alterations. i'm 5'7"" the model is 5'10"", so yeah 3"" shorter would be cute!"
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.
I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.
"This is silly, but the moss is not brown as pictured but olive green. with that ""said,"" i am going more casual, and i love the ""flex"" of this coat. the shape is beautiful and the lining is fun. i waited two months to get this in close to my size 00. for my style it is a keeper, but this back order situation is not acceptable. don't know whose fault that is?"
"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s"
I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.
These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.
"Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? 

this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back."
I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher, not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.
I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.
I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!
Ditto what the first reviewer said, unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar, i suspect, to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from
These culottes are adorable on....if you order up two whole sizes! they run extremely small. fabric is thick, high quality and a beautiful color.
Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.
"Skirt in med fit fine, cute,lightweight, swingy, flirty, fun, almost knee length
i am typically a 10-12
but the pattern which swings up, across, and down made me look wide in the hips as opposed to other clothes i own already
more petite, less curvy girls enjoy!
its going back,sorry!"
Got the small petite. length is perfect, love the color, super comfy, very pretty. the problem is that you cannot wear a bra because under the armpits is so low that either shows your bra (a lot) or if u wear sans bra you may show your breasts (it's loose all around on top, so very easy to show everything. if i adjust the straps it works but then the waist goes up and it looks like i have a belly. i'm taking to a seamstress to see if she can take in under armpits, if not it's going back. i'm 5',
These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.
I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo."
I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman, i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!
I did not realize that this knitted vest had an attached gauzy under-layer. i can see it now in the photo, but i just thought it wasn't part of the actual vest. when the vest arrived i realized sadly that this flowing under-layer was part of the design. i don't know why because the yarn and vest are lovely without it. in my opinion, the under-layer takes away from the beautiful vest. i guess i could have spent some time and removed it, but at that price i just sent it back. too bad because the m
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.
I like the skirt. that said it is going to the tailor to have some of the fullness taken out. just a lot of material going on, and heavier than you might have imagined. i will wear it fall & winter with white & navy cardigans.
"I think this may almost make it back to the more classic pieces retailer used to have. i tried on the xs in store so i ordered the xxs and xs petite... i felt the usual xs was a little big (again, i think retailer is making things bigger...) my verdict is iliked the length on the regular size better and the xxs fit well. but not much difference (the xs petite was a similar size be the arm hole was higher).
colors are very neutral and warm. i like the addition of the inner layer to make this more wh"
When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!
I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.
"This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!"
"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back."
These lightweight, wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute, but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide, adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.
Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.
"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.
this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.
the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down)."
This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.
I really like this skirt - so colorful! the interesting pattern and multiple colors will make this a great fall skirt. i can wear it with pink, burgundy, gray, white, black, and probably many more. can't wait for the temps to drop!
These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.
This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer
These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size, i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy, at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops, the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.
"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed"
I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!
These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.
"I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.

the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.
so glad i made this purchase."
The wide leg was fun, not too wide, but the long pocket seem to shorten leg so i returned. great for a taller person. bottom & trim cute
Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.
I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas
Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!
"Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!"
"I saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on. i was a bit disappointed. the size is tts but the prints were prettier online. the material is ok. the regular is long so probably won't look good on a shorter person
if it is still available when the price comes down, i might buy it."
The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.
I was so excited to receive these jeans. typically, wide leg jeans are a no brainer for me--super flattering and in chambray, i thought, they would be stylish and comfortable. but i found these to be verging on mom jean. something about them seems not so cool. maybe the color of the wash, the weight of the fabric? not sure, but they don't lend themselves to current looks. sadly, i will be sending them back.
"I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more!  fabulous quality, material and style.  can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts.  wear alone or layer.  don't miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!"
I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h
Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend
"Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger!
i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much.
fits perfect, i am 5'4"" 114lbs and purchase the regular small."
I loved this dress and it fit great on me: 5'7, 115 lbs, wore an xs. it was a little tighter than i wish, but the s would have been too loose. unfortunately, when i received the dress the arms were already pilling. it is made of a mix of polyester, and while it's machine washable (yay), i can imagine this dress would be pilling very easily, and i wish the fabric was a higher quality for the price, so i returned it.
"The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality."
I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isn't for me. the texture is too soft.
Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.
I was so excited when this dress went on sale.  it is very soft and the print is so distinctive.  it is super comfy but not slimming or flattering at all.  i am a curvy girl,  wear a medium 8/10 and this made me look so wide!  the skirt is quit full,  a small would have fit but the top was tight.  so disappointing.
I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.
After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
Was looking for a replacement coat and saw this lovely. tried on large but was more roomy than needed, even for a coat. tried petite version but found it too short for my taste. decided on medium in green and cannot complain. comfy & stylish. more car coat than main winter coat. have been wearing it daily over light layers so far in our mildish nw winter.
Another great dress by retailer. i've worn it with tall boots with heels, riding boots and booties...all look really good. i've also added a cream/beige cardigan and even a fuzzy/furry vest. very versatile. the only few things that i would have liked even more is that design of the dress be actual stitching and not just a flat print and also the material does shrink a tat when you wash it. it's a staple and keeper.
These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.
Luv these jeans! they felt so comfy the first time i put them on. it's like butter! i'm a 26 but went down a size and wear a belt. they said they r high rise but i can't see how - but no complaints as i can breathe in them :)
Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.
5'1'' 43-31-43. i really wanted to love this coat: the material is nice, the green color is dark and rich, it has a hood. however, the cut is bad for me (and probably a lot of other people). the shoulders were cut too wide and impeded movement, and the bust and hips were cut too tight, overall it was just boxy. i have another boiled wool coat that i bought at retailer about 7 years ago and though it's cut oversize like this one, it has a much fuller sweep, so the proportions still seem right. also
"First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4"" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes"
"The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers)."
I guess this is a true to size, i am usually a 30dd and ordered 32d, fits great. the back is really pretty, so even though it is a tiny bit looser, i decided to keep it...
I tried these on as a return at my store and sadly, they fit great everywhere ecept at the waist. i had almost 2 inches gaping at the waist... my usual size. the rest of the pant was absolutely awesome though. for reference, i tried n a 25 and am 115 lbs and short... bummer htey don't come in petite or 24...
"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it."
I love the feel and design of this pullover. it is extremely soft and comfy to wear. however, i did find that it runs slightly large, is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy. probably not the best for a petite frame. i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides.
"I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a"
"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp."
I was initially attracted to the colors
This coat is a perfect fall to winter transition coat. it is surprisingly warm in 50 degree weather, so i'm sure it will be warm enough in 30-40 degree weather with some added layers. the only thing to note is that it is unlined and the material is soft so it may be prone to pilling. can be worn casually, to work, and dressed up.
"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4"" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!"
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!
The colors in this dress are much less vibrant in person. the scoop of the neckline is very wide and deep. i know others have posted that this is a great dress for work, but not in my workplace.
I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.
"Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what ""eira"" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts."
"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming"
This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th
So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.
I really like these jeans, but order a size down. i'm typically a 14 and these were just too big. they stretch as it is and although they should have a baggier fit, they are just too baggie.
This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light"
"Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination.
i purchased the pink, which i saw online first a"
This is a comfortable sweater dress, and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel
"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e"
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.
Warn and super soft. love it !
Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.
Nice jeans, but had to return. too tight in hips/thighs and big in waist.
"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100."
I am 5'8 154 pounds and ordered a medium. the coat is a bit bigger than expected and should have gone down a size. i'm keeping this size however because it is incredibly comfortable, roomy and perfect for mild winters. the wool does keep you warm in 50 degree weather.
I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.
really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model
wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu"
"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!"
I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green
"Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2"" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it's a classic! you will smile!"
I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i
This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.
"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat, the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium, worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning, so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."
Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.
"I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!
i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly"
I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy, oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu
This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.
"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful
This tunic is very nice. flattering, good design, worn in winter and spring, and fits well. i have a curvy figure, and this fits well. i wish it came in more colors.it does show flaws slightly but fits well and is stretchy.
The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!
"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink."
I love this sweater! pros: great shape (it's supposed to be a little oversized looking), great color (i have the ivory and it's beautiful), and fits well (the sweater looks boxy until you put it on and it flows in all the right places). the sweater is not soft. that is my only con. it looks so soft in the photos, but the sweater i received is not at all soft and cozy. it is warm. it will be great for the winter - great pair with leggings, skirts or just jeans.
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right."
Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.
"I am 5'6"", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed."
"This is a beautiful dress but if you have any hips at all you may find it difficult to find the right size. i usually wear a 0-2 p and found that that the op was too snug on the bottom while the 2p was too loose on top. ( for reference 32-26-35). so if you are perfectly proportioned it could work for you.
also, note that this is a pencil dress....very slim fitting.....probably best suited for a cocktail party."
I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, and i am so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, and the material is so soft. i'm sure she's going to love it!
So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it, i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing, the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l, so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug, but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look, so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too, but i could have rolle
I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,
Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.
"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works."
Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.
Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.
"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!"
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall
I got the rooster version and the colors are simply gorgeous.  i'm not so much into wearing a farm animal image, but the colors are just too striking to pass this up. the sweater is tts, but with a slightly baggy fit. i did not find it scratchy.
I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite , and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit, it was very long, even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side, the blue was a very nice, cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice, just too much fabric for me. returning!
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.
I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,
Bought this is the blue, which is actually a very grey-blue.  i love cotton sweaters and they are not easy to find.  this one has lovely colors and unusual design, but is a bit too full.  that said, i am keeping it for the cotton/linen factor, alone.
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings."
"I love mixed media clothing, and this is no exception. i fell in love with this right away, and after being torn between the two colors, opted for the rose. it's very gorgeous in person - midweight and very soft. however, as soon as i put it on, i noticed the knit sides truly flare out; they don't lay nicely like on the model. it could be because of my large chest (36dddd), but everything below the chest seems to widen me. it might work better on someone with a straighter build or smaller chest."
"I've been looking for some new, casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8"", not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however, i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it, however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"
I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.
I love this tee but there is a lot of swing/ fabric so it can tend to make you look wide. also, i have a short torso to begin with but this tee is on the short side. i'm still undecided on whether i'm going to keep it b/c it's rayon/ poly and it's hand wash only. and i'm worried that one wash will make it shrink in length and it's already short. rayon knits have a tendency to shrink in length when washed so beware!
This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute, but better suited for someone smaller chested.
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!
"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!

i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot."
"I love byron lars. very taken with his fabrics and design concepts and i have ordered several of his dresses but i believe i need to surrender to the fact that they do not work for my body type. the dress is gorgeous in person: all the fabrics are great, the dress is fully lined and lots of nice finishing touches. it is a unique and very striking dress; this one i really wanted. however, it is designed for a woman who is proportionally longer, leaner with a larger bust size than i have. i ordere"
"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer."
"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions."
This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.
I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!
This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.
I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something
Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit."
"This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! 
i'm 5'2"", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. 

the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online. 
the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc"
I'm 5'2 around 125 lbs, muscular and petite, so i ordered a petite small and it fits great. the length is perfect, i can wear with heels or dress down with flops. it's lined, which i think most dresses and skirts should be, so i was happy about that. i was pleasantly surprised with the slits up both sides, to show a little leg....sexy. it's not too low cut that you have to wear a cami and ruin the neckline, so that's plus. my only issue was the fabric didn't line up on me the same as the model,
"As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.

the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.

i am 5'0"", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to"
This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs, however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits, but something to be aware of.
I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.
I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.
I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.
"This is a very comfortable, good-looking skirt. fits as shown. the zipper however is rather short, and it takes a bit of squirming to get it over the hips. once on, it's great.  it is not made in the usa, as stated. it is clearly marked ""made in mexico"" from ""globally sourced"" materials (i.e. not from the us)."
"I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, ""wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?"" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla"
I agree, this dress runs long, but since i love high heels, it falls just right for me. it does seem quite roomy for a medium, which is a pleasant surprise. the fabric, drape and quality are contemporary but i know i'll be wearing this beyond this year for sure.
Pretty pink top is great for layering iand alone in the summer and spring
This shirt fits very true to size, with very soft and comfortable material that hangs just right. wears well and is versatile for many occasions. please come out with more colors so i can purchase them as well!
I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to
"I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9"" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi"
I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...
"A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!
it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through"
I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore, i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.
After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the
I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless.
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.
I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.
"I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it, hoping that it'll fit me. 

i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper. 

i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress, i don't mind it."
"I agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long, but i love it! it's very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i don't think it runs ""super big"" but it's slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it's classy, different and hot!"
Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.
Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact,
There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced.
Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.
"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin"
Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,
Oh yes. another sequin top to add to my collection. it is sparkly without being glittery- if you know what i mean. can definitely dress down as it is tee shirt- like. lots of options for this one. tts.  much better in person than the online pics.
Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel, they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
The fabric is so beautiful that i am tempted to buy in a large size and have re-made. the waist is tiny. the hips are wide. when it goes to half price, i may be tempted to take it to my favorite alterations lady. the fabric is that exceptionally beautiful.
"These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!
i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.
i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.
i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect."
If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of
"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring."
I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!
This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
"I ordered these as i was curious of hte fit on my body type (shorter, thighs)... well, it was ok, but in the end, i dind't keep them as i would be better off wearing jeans on casual day, or ""real"" joggers (as in jogging material).

cut was ok, not super flattering, but tapered pants only suit stright legs in my opinion.

material was nice enough, din'dt notice wrikling, but i didn't wwear them, jsut tried them on.
grey color was nice."
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.
The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously, seriously see-through.
"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).
sadly, it's going back."
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!
I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.
"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?"
One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :)
These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.
I totally love this tank! the yoke detailing is so pretty! i read the other reviews...i feel it fits pretty tts, it's what i expected. i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail. i love it so much, i'm ordering it in the turquoise color as well. every time i have worn it, i have received compliments. i've worn it alone with shorts and/or jeans, as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work. it's soft, comfortable and to echo what another review stated, the material s
Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.
This dress is attractive but it runs a little small. i'm a small curvy girl who usually wears a 2. this was small in the top and short waisted. i wanted to wear it to a recent event and didn't have time to return it for another size.
"These leggings were way longer and darker then appeared on model. 
they also were see through or beige color when stretched across hip.
especially for the high cost, there are much better althleisure leggings on the market."
"A lovely skirt and i'm so glad i found it before the medium sold out! having said that, i expected the medium to run small and that i'd have to squeeze into it but having tried it on this evening it's not the case at all. i nice fit. i might even have fitted into a small, which i think is the only size remaining. the skirt is very spain inspired. very flamenco! i love it! i will say that you'd need a bit of height to wear this skirt due to the length at the back. i'm 5'6"" which is tall enough fo"
"First, the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green, it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds, whites, blues, pinks...virtually any color.

the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large, so i'd size down if you're between sizes.

and now, sadly, the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a"
I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu
Love this tank. it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide.
"I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge"
This is a beautiful fabric and the skirt is so nice. what is wrong is the cut of the skirt. one side bells out more than the other, giving it an off center look from the front. my legs were not centered.
First of all, the label on this dress is maeve, not nue by shani. second, i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny, which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall, i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.
I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.
I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .
I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!
"These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great."
L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.
I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).
These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
I love love this top. i was on the fence about it since it runs large and is loose fitting, very loose. i tried m, l, and xl. i usually wear xl but bought an l in this. i tried m, it was loose around the mid-section but fitted at the top. i wore them with fitted skinny pants and the top looks amazing. perfect for summer. the armholes also look flattering - not too big. i like turquoise. i didn't find yellow in the store, so bought green and white. it does need some ironing.
"This pants look pretty much exactly like the picture except these will wrinkle really easily so there is no way they will ever appear as wrinkle free as the pic.

i found the color to be exactly as seen online so i am not sure why others didn't. the material is really light weight so i think these will work well for spring.

overall cute especially for the price. if not on sale, i would not have bought them but the sale price makes these pants awesome."
This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.
These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.
"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. 

i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su"
I fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it. but was disappointed when i received it. first was the color. i chose the green and it wasn't what i thought. it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass. when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt. the color was that bad. the fit was the next problem. this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted. the top was loose and that added to the flowy
"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try"
I really wanted this. they had two size small in my local retailer, both were damaged. so disappointing. i don't want to pay shipping for one that hopefully isn't damaged:( in the last year i've had multiple quality control issues with retailer. makes me gun shy. not sure i'm getting what i pay for anymore.
Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.
I had been eyeing these for a while, but as they didn't seem very popular, i figured i'd wait for a sale. i finally bought them at the 40% off of sale price (yay!) and i love them. they're extremely comfortable, and very flattering. i'd say they run true to size, but maybe on the smaller end of the size for the waist. the blue pants are more greenish in color than the picture shows, but still beautiful. i'm looking forward to wearing these now and into the spring.
Easy and fun jumper. runs slightly large. i ordered a medium and returned for a small. can be dressed up or down for a variety of occasions. would be perfect if it had pockets.
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.
This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.
I was unsure about this dress when i first tried it on. the color is gorgeous, it is flowy and beautiful. it hits just below the knee (i am tall), which is something i am not used to. i hadn't decided on it, but my husband loves it and that's all that matters! it is very feminine and pretty. i normally wear a 0, but ordered a 00- it fits just slightly loose, which is the style this dress is going for.
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.
"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28, which fits loosely, but comfortably."
Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!
I really wanted to like his dress, but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts, so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall, it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad.
I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!
This runs really large. i love it! sold out of xs p and xxs p... go figure :( size down if you are slim.
Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro
A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!
This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i don't have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress.
This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.
Just purchased this- love how light and airy it is. perfect for throwing on on a warm summer day. it is soft and comfy, but it does run pretty large. i am normally a m, and in this the m was swimming on me. i purchased the s, and still loose and flowy. i wore a strapless bra with it, but will also try a bandeau or tank top.
I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)
"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs, i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees, instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
"This is one of those dresses that is just ""nice"" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it, it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but, it's a ""work horse"" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!"
"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.
style is fun and flir"
This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl
These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while.
Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.
This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it.
"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!

fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap"
I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet
I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small."
I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy
Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however, the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite, i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san
I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.
This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
"This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2"" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips."
"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide, and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also, not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute."
Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!
"After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3"" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions."
"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top."
"Fit is true to size but keep in mind this dress has a ""box-like"" fit. i am debating whether to have mine taken in a little under the arms.
the material isn't what i expected but i still love it. the dress has a more textured/thick fabric instead of the light, somewhat silky fabric that the photo portrays.
i am very happy with the color!"
This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!
I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
It looks great on the model but not on me. on me, it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.
This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.
"This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to."
If there ever was the perfect feminine dress, this would be it .
I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
I had reservations about this top based on other reviews, but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin, but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.
I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!
I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!
"I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3"" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future."
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.
I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!
Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.
I love the idea, and color, very flattrering and easy to trhrow on, however, i need the petite in this one, and they sold out in the neutral color. it looks too big in eregular sizing, and since it combines xs/s, it is made slightly bigger. material is soft enough.
I received this in the mail a few days ago, and was so pleased with it except that it was huge! i am normally a 10/12 in most things so i ordered a large. i was swimming in it in all areas - shoulders and bust bothered me most because i need a waist on shirts so i don't look larger than i am. i liked it enough to o ahead and order a size down. i ordered a medium and medium petite because the top is quite long and i think i could get away with wearing it with leggings or tights if i were looking
"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are"
"Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits. (i live in florida, and these tops make great beach cover ups). i am 5'7"" and over 160 but not busty, and the medium was swimming on me, but i think this particular shirt is supposed to be that way. su"
Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.
I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!
"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
"The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7"", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch"", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
I'm very pale, and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin, though.
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi
I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality, it runs really large. also, in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress, not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)
This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!"
Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering"
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass."
The rose color is lighter than the photo of the model in front of the pink building, but on the other photos it does look lighter so i wasn't surprised.  my dress fits very nicely. i love the drop waist, the loose fit at the hips, and the flare of the ruffles.  the back is just like the model too. i thought it may be boxy but it comes in at the waist and goes a-line. perfect. i ordered the xl because it wanted it to be loose like on the model.  i was afraid because of my large dd chest it would
I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons, but i may be able to
I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product"
Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it."
Like the extra details on the neck and back - and it's versatile to wear everywhere
Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.
"This dress is a bit scratchy, but overall i liked the fabric well enough. on someone blond and fair, the peach color washes out a bit. the issue for me with the dress is that front is just too short for my height (i'm 5 9 1/2). it looked a bit obscene. 

the small otherwise fit me great. i have broad shoulders, small chest and and slim."
This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore
I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w
"I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person."
I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!
"I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. 

i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice."
This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.
"Cute white t-shirt different style but didn't work on my body type so i returned it 
 good price point 
 basic fabric"
This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"
I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.
I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store. i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it. it fits a little big -- definitely size down. but other than that, i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this. the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waist/tiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it, despite it being the perfect fabric for day. i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later.. it can be dre
....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.
"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!"
"I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11"" and slim and the top hung nicely on me."
I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.
"This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look ""thick"". highly recommend!"
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so
"This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5""1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!"
This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!
I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe
The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!
Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer
Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy, i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.
"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly."
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it"
In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!
An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words, i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist, it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.
I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing.
Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric, this is a great special occasion dress.
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.
I wanted to love this dress, and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me, however, the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close, so sad
"I ordered the grey/yellow ""here comes the sun"" shirt. it's cute, but it runs quite large and isn't special enough for the price. meh."
This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.
I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted
"I wanted to love this dress as it would have been perfect for a wedding i have in october however, the fit was awful;. the dress was heavy with a funky liner. it also had these little black straps around the top of the arm/neck that looked out of place. it ran true to size but i have a large chest (32dd) and it was pretty fitted around the area but loose everywhere else. 

sadly, dress had to be returned."
"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!"
"It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!
it is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature."
I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.
Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well
I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.
"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper."
I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.
Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!
"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up."
I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!
"The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites, but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well, if not better, depending on the length of the outfit!
______________
pros:
- looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.
- well made, good stitching, solid dress.
- great length in the sleeves.
- fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my"
"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!"
"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer."
This is a really flattering tee for my curves. pretty lace details. i purchased the gray and ordered the wine. the pink looked more peach to me in the store. only reason for 4 stars is that the back material wrinkles easily. true to size (large) for me.
Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!
I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.
"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right."
"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.
the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.
no need to say - it's going back asap.
you should not sel"
"I have been wanting this sweater and decided to order. when i received it, there was no tag on the product. it was not in a typical clear bag from retailer and it wasn't packaged nicely. it came from reno, nv. most products i order do not get shipped from there. it is short, and i'm 5'1"". most clothes that are short fit me with no problem. this sweater might hit me at the waist, or maybe shorter. i think the color is nice and the sweater is soft but not what i wanted. i am going to return it"
Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s
I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!
I love the style of this dress and the color is beautiful and very much like the photo. like previous reviewers mentioned, the top is a little loose in comparison to the bottom. i originally bought a size 4 but then exchanged it for a 2. i tend to be between those sizes. the 2 fits great on bottom but the straps are a bit loose. it might be better for bigger busted ladies!
"I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.

this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days."
Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
Bought this in green at my local store and fell in love with it! i also tried one in pink and it was a bit sheer which is why i opted for the green color instead. very nice and feminine.
Very cute dress but the skirt flares out more than it looks in the picture. this made my midsection look unflattering from the side. also, for some who is on the flat chested side, you need a good bra or alteration (at least for me). despite what i listed above, i kept the dress since it's a versatile dress for many occasions.
I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.
Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!
"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2"" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine."
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it
Gorgeous fun dress, but the cut in the armholes (6 petite) is really low. so low even a strapless bra peeks above it. there are also lining issues (could have been with just my one choice) where the lining is not stitched well around the armholes so it shows too much. back is stunning. i would say that if you can go bra less this could be so awesome. it didn't work for my body because i have to wear a bra, but i think its a winner for someone.
I kept the size 8 of the dress and had to return the 10 as it was too roomy at the arms and chest (which is great!!!). material is nice and not too much material, hangs nice (its a swing). another win!
Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed.
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.
This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.
Love this dress. the fabric is super soft and flowy. be aware that the model is a tall gal.... i'm usually a size 8/10 in dresses and purchased a large. returned it for a large petite as it went way past my knees. looks funny if it is below the knee. the petite is perfect.
I tried on the xs in the store (115 lbs, 30dd chest, short). fit: i think it is a little big, i would tend to go for a xxs petite in this for me, the length was ok, but would look more flattering in petite. also, the waist was on the looser side. the green color is amazing though, very flattering and springy/summery. the flow of the dress is also very nice. the weird thing is the belt at the waist, it starts a little off from the seam, and doesn't go all the way around, not sure if i love it or
"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!"
"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me
definitely a keeper!"
"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!"
"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color, which in real life just looks like a very, very dark brown. that would probably be okay, but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length, but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way, way too short. i am 5'5"", for reference. lastly, i think the fabric is just awful quality, especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.
"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric"
"This dress had so much promise from the picture. i loved the midi length, color, and fascinating waist detail. i ordered online, so there was no way to try on before purchasing. the fit was disappointing. it fell in an unflattering manner at every point; a tad too low at the waist; a tad too long at the shin. just kind of saggy all around. bummed, but this is not to say it wouldn't fit someone with a different body shape better. the quality of fabric is nice, and the color is lovely."
This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.
"I'm a big fan of paige jeans. these are perfect for my petite frame. at 5""3' they were ankle length. i tried my normal paige size and ultimately sized up for a better fit at the waist."
This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.
This is, like many reviewers stated, a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great, because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm, only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me, and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young, too trendy? i don't know, when you're in your 40s, you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel
I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!
"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this."
"The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. 
sending back"
I tried this on in store and was very close to purchasing, but ultimately decided against it because it was too in between causal and dressy to me. i couldn't imagine where i would wear the dress. it was great quality and the green color was very pretty on. you could find a way to wear a bra with the dress.
I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
I loved this dress and purchased it in my usual m. however, i agree with another reviewer that it is too long for me at least, so i returned this and will buy it in petite instead. if you are shorter (i'm 5'2), the regular length doesn't fall right, the shorter front section falling right at the knee and the longer section falling halfway on my calf . but great style! looking forward to seeing it on me in the petite.
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!
This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.
Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it."
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!"
"Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3"" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#."
Love the style of this dress (length, hem, waist details, material)! i think it looks best on curvy women due to the waist detail only going part way around. it doesn't give the entire waist definition, which is why it would look best on someone who has a naturally defined waist. this is a pretty unique dress, which is one of the reasons i liked it. i agree with one of the previous reviewers about it being hard to conceal your bra straps. unfortunately for me that is a deal breaker because i rea
"The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high."
"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.
the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end."
"Hi ladies,
does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do"
I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!
This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.
Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.
Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.
This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall, i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...
You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?
I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.
Great fit and design but the wool is too itchy and rough. will need a layer underneath
This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.
While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.
I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!
I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it
"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable."
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid"
This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms, and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket, but it's just too sloppy.
I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.
I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod"
"Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4"". i usually wear a size 12 or 32"" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:("
"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs."
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.
It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.
I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over, and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top
This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big."
Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in
I bought three of these this summer--a mint, ivory, and yellow. when i received them, they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but, then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap, outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside
Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans .
I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th
This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.
Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2"", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this."
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.
This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s
Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.
Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi"
"I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, "" give it a chance"". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi"
"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!"
"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b, 150 5' 9"", tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric."
This is really cute - it has a boxy look and bell-like sleeves. the knit is chunky and so very soft. i didn't want to take it off. i purchased an xs in black. it's gorgeous. my beige bra shows through so i will need to wear black or a camp underneath. it feels really heavy - in a good way - and it feels like it will be really warm. the black has a velvety look to it. i'm smitten. i should also mention that it did feel cropped to me - i know i read other reviews that said it wasn't cropped. i fee
Lovely knit and so soft, but the bottom curls up underneath, similar to the bell sleeves. runs oversize too, got xs and it's too bulky and unflattering since the bottom doesn't lay flat. returned!
I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!
"Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago, and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday, and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they"
Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! ."
I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops, but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti
I have been on the hunt for a replacement cargo jacket for about a year now. i thought this one was going to be it!! ordered it right away. i got it in an xl as retailer coats always seem to run small on me (i am very busty so sometimes the more fitted styles won't even close without a big gap). this is not the case with this jacket. it runs really big - it looks like it could be an xxxl...but the design is great with a zipper and button closures, pockets and cute back cut...the color is slightly
"I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.

i will be returning this."
Received december 23 and 83 degrees in louisiana but weather can change from hot to cold in an hour. this sweater is so soft, so cozy, i'm ready to run the air conditioning! beautiful styling, well-made, and has a generous fit that you may or may not prefer. this will be one of my very favorite garments . luxurious, and i deserve it. i ordered a large, have long arms, and the sleeves do come over hand as shown in photo. it is very loose and flows over my jeans. i am an extremely difficult to ple
This sweater is great for cold weather. it is very comfortable and soft. only down side is it is a little boxy.
"I *loved* the brown color on the model, and i love the wrap style in general. however, i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7"", 137 lbs 32 b), which fit, but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin, but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me, so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s"
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.
Someone returned my size so i got to try it on in store. the cut is very flattering, the material is stretchy. the lace part is nicely made too. overall great piece. the petite waist did hit me a little higher than on model, i have a regular torso and short legs (and overall usually need petite)
If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.
I really love the look of this jumpsuit, casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and, similar to another reviewer, proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture, but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows, and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
"I&#39;ve been looking for comfortable pants that i could wear to work and at home.  these fit the bill.  i bought these in the holly color for the fall and winter.  they are super soft and very comfortable.  i was worried that they would like dumpy, especially around the seat area, but they fit fine."
However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...
Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall
Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.
This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!
I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however, after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust, combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma
This dress is comfortable and versatile - one could wear it to the office or to a social event, day to night. i didn't find the sizing to run as large as some of the other reviewers did. i felt it was true to size. it is not lined so you would need a slip under it if you wear it with tights or nylons, otherwise the skirt will cling.
Such a beautiful print. i sized up to a 14 because it looked like it has a high waist and it does. the waist comes almost to my bra line. unfortunately, there's a huge amount of fabric and it swallowed me. not slimming at all. i felt like i was wearing a curtain.  i loved the slits in the photo but due to the amount of fabric they weren't visible. i'm short and this literally pooled on the ground a few inches. if you're tall and thin, this is a beauty.
"I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.

i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on"
These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!
Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants
Unlike other reviewers, i found these pants to run true to size (in my case, my usual 6) or even a tad roomy. the red pattern is just festive enough for informal holiday parties. i appreciate the belt loops!
"Decent quality. i am 5'4"" 130 pounds. m is too big. runs slightly large."
Very comfy and flattering. cool on a hot day. slightly difficult to use the restroom, though.
"These pants are so fun. i love the pattern and color. can be dressed up or down. very flattering.
highly recommend trying them on, they were better than i expected them to be"
I bought these on a whim, patterned bottoms aren't normally my thing. i was pleasantly surprised. they fit well, look great and i had lots of compliments.
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.
This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.
Beautiful patterns and colors, but it sits very high and runs small. i'm normally a size 4 and got the small. zipped all the way, but on the snug side. the skirt sits so high that the fabric coming down was a bit awkward. such a shame because it really is beautiful and looks great on the model probably because she's wearing a belt to hide how high it rides and flares out.
I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!
"I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:
_________________
pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:
- i"
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.
Love sundry. great quality. if you want a looser more comfy fit size up!
Beautiful colors
This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty, this is great, but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy, but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra, which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly, so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy, which i liked very muc
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.
"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable, with gorgeous embroidered detailing, but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio, i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist, the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened."
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!"
I was a little surprised when i received this dress, as it is little more than an a-line tube with elastic casing at the top and a cute knotted detail at the bust. i guess i expected the bust to be lined at least. it is unlined, and a relatively thin jersey knit. it wasn't see through, for it is black, but i expected a heavier fabric. i would never have paid full price for this, but at the sale price it is very cute and comfortable. it is also flattering and the fit is true to size. the a-line t
This shirt is so great. it's beautiful and functional. i received countless compliments the first time i wore it. i'm looking forward to wearing it again! worth the steep price, though it was hard to justify.
"Very pretty blouse. it does run quite large, i am usually an xs-s or 0-4 and purchased the 0. i could probably have gone to a 00. for reference i am 5'4"" 118 lbs 34b/c. it says that it is dry clean only, however i washed in in delicate cycle with cold water and threw in the dryer for a little bit. it came out perfect! i was hoping to shrink it and it only shrunk a tiny bit. i was hoping for it to shrink more but it is fine. no need to even iron it! i was lucky enough to get it on sale, i don't t"
The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality
I purchased this top in the taupe color, and it is much prettier in person than it photographs online. it runs about a half size too large, and sits slightly off the shoulders. fun casual top for the fall.
This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece."
I've been adoring this online and while in store i happened upon this blouse and tried it on. the material was sturdy and the beading oh-so lovely, but on my frame it looked terrible. (i normally wear size m/10 in retailer clothes). as another reviewer mentioned, this blouse has rather puffy sleeves which aren't evident in the photo of the model. as well, i also didn't love the collar, which doesn't quite lay flat. if i were to buy this i would have to wait for it to go on sale and then get the po
This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to
Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning.
"Tried this lovely with high waste, wide leg, black flowy pants. everything i could hope for and more, but not quite!

size: blindly ordered size 6. i'm usually a small, occasionally xs in retailer brands like floreat and akemi+kin. i'm 5'5"" tall, 130 lbs, 34d, 35-29-37, long torso, narrow shoulders, and short arms.

fit: size 6 had just enough space through the bust. the lace edged sleeves were roomy and just reached my wrists. the shoulders were just right. extra fabric ballooned out around t"
Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!
The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.
It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.
"When i first pulled this shirt from the box i thought it was a for sure winner. the beading was stunning, it was just so elegant and the details are perfection. ""till i tried it on and had some reservations. the sleeves (at the top) were very poofy and just would not lay in a flattering way unless they were rolled above my elbow to tighten them. and as a taller gal, i wish it were a tad longer (in the model shot, looks a bit short from the back view). i fear tucking it would loosen the bead work"
I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s
This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.
Great t. great lightweight, almost linen like fabric. a bit on the sheer side, but love the fit and the neckline!
I bought this for my mother and she really loves it. it is a bit on the large side for her but have decided to keep it. the quality seems very good and great styling for a washable item! i actually like it so much i may order one for myself!
"I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9"" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized ""boyfriend"" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol"
Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.
"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small"
"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner."
I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors.
This was what i was looking for ! the little stripes ,black and white color,the shape of the jacket and skirt together....well perfect. kind of. i purchased this entire ensemble. the skirt was going to be shortened because well i'm short. no problem ,this is a common occurrence for me. but the jacket would not work for me. the sleeves were way too tight for my muscular arms. there was no way the adorable shirt would fit in there. the shirt is adorable by the way. all of these pieces are made ver
This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however, it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso, but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried, it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short, if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static, this truly is a beautiful top.
The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape.
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!
I really like this vest. personally, i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short, especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that
I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev
I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite, way too much fabric. returned.
"Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments. 
unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!"
Lovely embroidery with a classic look, great addition to your wardrobe.
At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of
I honestly never even tried this on - i ordered it and when it arrived it was not the kelly green color pictured, it was more of a dark bland green color. love the brand and very soft but had to return.
This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!
This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist, tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts, but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.
"I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. 

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!"
"I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8"" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall."
"The design is graceful and both my kids said it was a keeper ""pretty,"" even the boy child.

somehow i feel it makes my tummy look bigger than it is, maybe with the belt on my jeans."
"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized , therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders , the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small
"Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.   
i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt. 
i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt. 
i highly recommend it, and think it's a great price. 
it is longer than on the mode"
I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.
I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so, it's too big but the length works), or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable, and the design is different in a good way.
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.
This is a very nice dress. the jersey is soft and high quality. the construction appears solid. the color is very pretty, and looks in real life just like it does on my computer. the cut and draping just don't work for me. there's just too much draping, too much fabric. it overwhelmed me and made me look bigger than i am. i have a feeling this would be much more flattering on a curvier figure than my own. this dress seemed to be trying to accentuate curves i don't really have (especially in the
I tried this on in-store and would have purchased if it have been a better price, it wasn't something i could justify spending $100 bucks on. it's cute and was surprisingly comfortable but again, not worth the asking price. i will buy when it goes on sale.
"I was out of town when my coat arrived, and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet, but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7"" and heavier than i'd like, but the xl fit perfectly!"
I ordered this in my usual size 0 and couldn't finish zipping up the top, but also couldn't fill in the boobs. i am 5'7, 116 lbs, 32a. it is very cute, but the top was pretty stiff and unless it draped on you correctly, could probably be bothersome. i was disappointed in the quality of the skirt- no lining, simple cotton/polyester. i will probably return, try the size up, but was disappointed compared to how excited i was for it. i did like that it had pockets, and would be a fun dress to wear f
"I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.

when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f"
Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up.
"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear."
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.
I love the style of this dress, but unfortunately, it runs very small. i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it. also, the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem.
This dress did not work for me. i tried it in my bigger size 6 since i am coming off winter weight gain. the dress fit tts but was squishing the breasts like tight bandages. i have smaller chest and the stretch bodycon fabric of the bodice made me look flat-chested. the straps did not sit flat on shoulders, i assume because they were not pulled tight enough by the chest. the dress was uncomfortable and felt strange on. but i can see how others with more curves on top will love the support of the
When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!
This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.
"I get so many compliments with this skirt! i love almost everything about it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i find the slit a little annoying. i think it's maybe a little too long (or short, i can't figure it out) but i couldn't pass up this skirt because the pattern is so pretty.

fits true to size, soft fabric, very cute."
The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.
/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.
"Love this button down, but i couldn't make it work. i'm 5'4"", 32b, and usually buy tops in a regular xs or s. i bought this top in a small and it was loose fitting which i liked, but too long for me causing the pleats to flare out more than i liked. the shirt is also pretty sheer, wear a skin colored bra unless you want it noticed. the material was soft and looked like good quality."
I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
"Tried this on at my local retailer, the red color is pretty but not a ""true"" red. the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days. two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it ""opening"" up to the world! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra, this is a deal-breaker for me, it can't be fixed."
I ordered one of the xl in the red version. the fit is true to size. it matches the model's photos. the color is much prettier in person. it looks washed-out on my computer. but, in person, it's a nice light red. the quality of the material is okay. not as good as with the floral version of this style (florascura tank). the layers are flattering for my pear-shape. it definitely needs a tank underneath though. not worth full-price in my opinion but worth getting on sale.
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!
This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it, which is awesome, and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also, the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.
I love the unique design of this dress.  it also has a nice thick material.  the top part runs small.  i'm normally between size 6 and 8.  i bought this dress in size 10 and the top part is still snug, whilst size 12 is too loose.  the bottom part has a nice flowy material with pockets.  since the top part is snug, it will best not to wear a bra plus the thick material will provide a nice support.  the down side of this dress is that the straps are running long.  i have a short torso, so there's
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops)."
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.
So, so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!"
I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!
First, i love this top overall. it is simple and classic and has a flattering, forgiving cut. i agree there is a major design flaw as other reviewers have mentioned. the v-neck is so deep and falls so low you need to wear a camisole underneath. instead i chose to take a stitch at the neckline to keep it together where i wanted it, and that worked beautifully. i think the top should have included either a small button or snap to hold the neckline up properly or should have been stitched together
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a"
"This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu"
Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!
I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.
I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.
"I have a shorter torso and so i usually love dresses that hit right at my waist- so this dress seemed perfect! 
i ordered a size 2 petite, which fit very well. the regular two (in picture) was not as well made. the straps didn't fit as well. they were less of an ""x"" and way more fabric. petite fit great. i think this dress is really fun but not very mature. i returned it because it didn't feel adult enough for the event."
Just picked this up in black in the store. on the hanger it looks like just another v-neck tank, but it is quite flattering on. however, the v-neck is quite exaggerated and loose, i will be pinning it so it doesn't sag open. :)
I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!
This is a nice lightweight summer top to wear with a pair of shorts. it is low cut though - lower than i expected so i wear a tank underneath it. the layers are flattering.
This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.
I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back.
"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty"""
This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece.
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!
"So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.
fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good, sleeves are a not too tight."
This is a beautiful sweater, but if came up weirdly high on me in back, higher than it looks on the model. she must have on high waisted pants.
"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me, so even at the sale price they're going back."
I was so excited to order this dress, had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.
Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres
As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!
I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
The first reviewer summed up many of my thoughts exactly. i don't like to go without a bra and this dress with its slightly wider, almost cap-sleeve straps solves my problem perfectly. i love this neckline and wish i'd see it in more maxi dresses! the crossover and cutouts in the back mimic the lines of a traditional indian sari blouse and skirt, again without sacrificing bra coverage. just a beautiful and inspired design - definitely a standout in the sea of summer maxi dresses i've seen. i lov
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down."
"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret"
"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!"
Lovely assemblage of prints, looks great in motion. but the waistband runs a touch large. if you're between sizes, maybe size down.
The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.
"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3"", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze"
If you happen to get a size that fits you, you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair, both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also, not sure who named these colors, but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size
"I've been wanting to add some cords to my wardrobe and had to give these a try. i ordered the blue color on-line in size 31. i'm somewhat in-between size 30 and 31 in jeans right now, so i thought i'd be on the safe side and go up. i ended up keeping these and i'm happy with my purchase, although i do feel like the cut of the leggings is a bit off for me. i am a proportional hour-glass shape and i found these leggings to be quite snug in the thigh, while being oversized in the waist.
in the end,"
I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
Soft, comfy, flattering, just a beautiful dress. it works for any occasion. i can't express how much i love it!
"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly."
I have been searching for great bra friendly maxis and the design and colors of this one are exactly what i was looking for. i love how the front and back dip down and the open back with crossover detail is really sleek looking.  overall, it's tts, but the chest is a little low cut, so some will want to size up for extra coverage.  the fabric is a silky jersey made of mostly rayon (95%) and spandex (5%) with a mesh nylon/spandex lining from the top through where the cream color ends at the botto
Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6"""
Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you
"This dress had beautiful details, and the material was better than i expected; however, it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack."
"I wanted to love this, as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.

but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.

the fabric, though nice quality, has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch, but i'd just say"
This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.
These are really great legging style cords. you can wear them without worrying about covering your bum in my opinion! they are not too bulky at all which you might expect in a corduroy pant. they are a tad loose in the waist area unfortunately but fit me well in the thighs, so i don't think sizing down would work for me. i bought the bronze, and it's a very versatile color! darker than the picture, but still a good color. i feel it will be perfect for fall and spring especially. i'll wear it all
These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.
I really like this pullover. the design is beautiful, and i love the asymmetrical hem. my own complaint is that the fit is a bit boxy on me because i'm large-chested. it's more drapey than tailored. but it's not overwhelming and doesn't cancel out how much i like it overall.
The flow and feel of the material is really nice, however, i think it runs large. i ordered a small, and i have exchanged it for an xs, which i am hoping fits a bit better. i wanted the pants to be a bit more fitted around the hips and flow from there.
This cute dress is swingy and chock full of fun little details.  love the embroidery, colors, crochet lace, tassels, wide sleeves.  don't like that it's all polyester and some embroidery is unraveling so i don't know what to do about that.  size down if your petite or slender.  i'm a med-large (135# 36c 38-27-35) and medium fit great at the bodice/shoulders.  hem hits my knees in regular size.
"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium"
"True to size. length is perfect for 5'8""-5'9"". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty."
"This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2"",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr"
"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?"
"I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it."
Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!
"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re"
I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.
"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length."
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.
"These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.

i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam."
The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!
Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.
I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.
"As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big ""thank you"" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3"" ordered size"
"I am just over 5'8""and i found that these pants hit me in a weird spot on my torso, almost creating a muffin top that i don't normally have. in addition, they were too short on me to give the chic and modern look of cropped ankle pants. on my frame, they fit more like capris from the late 1990s. both the construction and execution of the pants are otherwise fantastic."
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.
Love these pants. super light and great color. they are a bit long though
This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe"
This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth
Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.
These jeans are well-made, the cut is decently flattering, but on more muscular thighs, it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle, so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height), then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small, but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall, ok but returning them. (25 p ordered, 115 lbs, 26.5 in
"Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store, and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great, i wanted navy, but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar, so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time, i will be grabbing those as well.

i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)"
I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them,. i exchanged for the next size up, because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store, i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.
I love love love the fit in the corduroy, so thought about grabbing these jeans as well. they fit much pretty well, just the color wasn't quite right. i'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans, and these don't quite match the coloring in the photo. still debating whether to keep them. love the cuff styling and straight leg fit!
Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th
I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love
"These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how ""modern"" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and"
"I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5""2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches ."
"I'm an avid retailer shopper.
i bought this dress for my niece, her style tends to run 
bohemian/gothic.
the style, fabric and overall design/quality of this dress, is something i felt she would like (even though the color is not black).
she loves it - perfect fit. she accessorized it with her usual biker/moto jacket,boots, etc.
but it looks awesome on her!"
Short and wide. the color and print are so pretty, but the shape isn't flattering, at least not to me. might work better on a teen?
Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.
I'm keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it's such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don't need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it.
"I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful, soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1"", 102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!"
I was excited to try something by this designer and decided to order size large. unfortunately, this top just looked very odd. cute from the front but it wings out in the back where the sleeves meet the arms. the fabric makes an odd poof in that area. i do have a large bust and it didn't pull anywhere in the front. i expected it to be soft and drapey but the cotton feels very coarse and doesn't drape well. it covered my behind in back. unfortunately it made me look wide from the side view. i hav
I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.
"These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them."
"I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my ""go to"" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of"
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs, and 38-32-40 and my normal size 10s fit me perfectly."
The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!
These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.
I love these pants and have two colors from last season. they are well-made and versatile. however, given the amount they stretch and the summer season for sandals, 30.5 is a tad long for petite. i'll have them hemmed an inch to keep them from dragging on the floor. also, i wish the coral and green came in petite.
Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!
"I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10"", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly."
The retailer store had mostly white left of these pilcro linen pants so i tried them on. the main reason i did not leave the store with them is because i could see the washing tag inside the pants as clear as day. the white pants were just too see-through and i was really looking for some casual items to wear to the office. if it was at least lined, these pants would have come home with me. otherwise, i think the fit was tts.
I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.
"These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or ""girlfriends'"" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend"
"I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7"" and 133 lb and got a size 4."
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering."
"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle."
I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.
"It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the"
"I own this shirt in dark green,
navy, and white.
it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.
it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.
and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).
well done!"
"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however, i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse, it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it."
I love these jeans and have been wearing them a lot now that the weather is turning a bit cooler in my area. i like that the cuff is not sewn in, so you can wear them with a cuff like pictured, or fully unrolled/down. they are a bit higher-waisted than i prefer - kind of an awkward waist height in my opinion. and they are very stretchy. i was torn between two sizes so i went with the larger. i wasn't sure of how to mark how they fit because they are somewhat fitted/slim in the thigh area, but th
I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen
This looked like such a cute, casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said, it runs small. i'm usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on. i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips. however once on, i couldn't figure out how i'd wear this. i wouldn't pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didn't seem like a good idea either. between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha
This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.
I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in"
Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern, however, the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.
Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view, the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure, so while the look as you approach walking
"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

i was going back and forth between xs and s. i decided on small because it fit better in my arms, didn't feel as tight. the xs fit well in the torso area and didn't have as much fabric as the small. the small also had a longer shirt tail. 

if you don't have as much mass in the arms, get the xs. if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms, it's better to go with the small."
I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday. i thought the design was fluid, summer appropriate, and easy like sunday morning. i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color. and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizing/fit. i totally respect other reviewers, so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday, so much so that i went and put it on again, sans issues.i am n
"Cute design with interesting details. i felt it ran a bit large. i'm 5'8"", 135 lbs, an 8 was too big and baggy. my biggest complaint with this skirt is the color. it's just not flattering."
"Okay, i get the idea of the loose swing dresses but i have a couple that do it well without looking like a moo-moo. i ordered my ""typical"" pxs. the length was good and the color beautiful. i like the details of the dress but it was huge and not in a flattering swingy drapey way. i was undecided if i should try the pxxs as the pxs was so large that i don't know if the pxxs would fix this problem for me. i will still be thinking about it."
"Dear creatures always has sizing issues. they run the gamut of bust-problems. i'd been salivating for this dress for a long time so i really did my homework. at 5'7"", 130-135 lbs, 34c, 28"" waist - typically a 4 in dresses... i bought the small. each dress is cut from the same fabric, leaving each dress's color swatch placement to be randomly determined. as a result, i've seen some dresses have only pink, purple, and green. i lucked out and got every color represented. so the dress you see may no"
"Fell in love with this the moment it arrived in stores. whimsical but work--appropriate. i'm typically a 4 in dresses. i would say this skirt runs tts; however, the front pleats will create a pouch-y stomach if you have a small waist and a lucious anything-below-your-waist. size up one size to avoid this. the waist size will be loose, but it will allow the pleats to lay flat. absolutely lovely with a mock neck sleeveless top. also great with solid white, black, or printed blouses. not a true pen"
This skirt is very pretty, but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized, so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements, there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.
This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40. i'm normally a size 10, but i took a 12 in this skirt.

2. it's comfortable and has pockets that you can really put your hands in.

3. sits at high waist. hem hits below the knee.

4. i didn't like the buttons. they are very round and stick out quite far. they are also mismatched. i would have liked them better if they were flatter.

5. i also didn't like the mustard color. it's unflattering to me."
This is a great basic tee (purchased in navy) but fits much larger than it appears on the model. the arms/chest area fit fine but it really billows out below. the front is shorter and the back is longer than i would've expected. i thought this would be great for summer, but it's really too long in the back to wear with shorts. it does, however, look great with skinny jeans.
I absolutely love this gorgeous cardigan. i will wear it for years to come!!
"I tried this skirt in my usual size s, and although it fit, it was too short for my liking and made my hips look wide b/c of the way it billowed out. the size m looked much better- hit me right below the knee in the front. (i'm 5'2"") my skirt is much more high-low than the picture. also, it sits much lower on my waist, which i like. i bought the blue, and with the color variations, it is gorgeous- reminds me of a chambray or denim coloring. i rolled it up to take on vacation, and it traveled rea"
"I love this skirt! it is a lovely and soft gauze layer with lining underneath. i live where the summer""s are hot and humid and this skirt keeps me cool when everything else just sticks to me. it is, for sure, very limited because it does not have a zipper.... if you cannot get this over your hips or over your shoulders and bust, this is not the skirt for you. the elastic waistband is really strong and really highlights your waist, but yes, i am petite and i struggle to get it on. once it is on,"
One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede
Love the deep purple color of this cardi sweater - long and drapey looks great with leggings skinnies and jeans. my only problem is the way the loose stitching around the cuffs is makes it worrisome. wore once and already starting to get a hole. still a great piece.
Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!
I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca
I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami
This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin
Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35
"What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on."
"This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame......."
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty
"I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2"" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som"
This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.
I loved this top . it is beautiful.
The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.
So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.
Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.
Cute dress that is perfect for a casual summer wedding or brunch with friends. i love the material and that the dress is lined. it is very comfortable and it has pockets. this is definitely more of a ?golden? yellow vs. a soft yellow. my only complaint is that i wish it were cinched more right below the bust. it would give the dress (and me) more shape. i would say this dress is true to size but if you have a larger chest, you will likely want to size up. if you have a small chest, i would proba
Material is hard to wear a bra under it
Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy, so the 0 fit perfectly.
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!
Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight, allows no room for extra tummy, hips, booty, or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top), but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m, would have definitely sized up, as i really liked the look.
"I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5"" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts"
Beautiful, unique, colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale, this is a no-brainer
The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
"Received this dress yesterday, love it!
my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept..
but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring.
delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green.
it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead.
this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i"
"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect, falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly, which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip, to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
"This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!"
"Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36"" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made."
I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
I bought the pink, which is a vibrant but not neon shade of deep reddish pink. love it. i love how the flutter of the sleeves is balanced with a slimmer fitting body, which keeps it from looking frumpy. i did order a size down to achieve this look. i prefer a more tailored look so this suits me while satisfying my desire for a little whimsy now and then. my only issue is that it's too low cut. trying to decide if i just need to wear it with a lower-cut bra or if this requires a cami. i hate laye
"Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the
vee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length
ordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings."
As one would expect from boucle, this sweater is incredibly soft, warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful, goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling), and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs, with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.
These jeans are awesome! i usually wear a 26 in ag jeans as they tend to stretch, but i ordered a 27p because i am only 5'1 and these are a flare style. i have a small waist but a larger booty, and these jeans hug me in all the right places. they also have a great dark color and are super classy so you can dress them up if need be. the only thing i didn't like was the length. even with the petite size i have to wear wedges so they don't drag on the ground. but, this is an issue i have with most
I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.
"I wrote item ran large, but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10"" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice, but it does have some issues."
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.
This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.
"This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it's casual yet dressy at the same time. 

re: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it's so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size -"
Love the pockets! fits loose, but lies nicely. comfy but able to be dressed up or down. great versatile dress.
I'm so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe. i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. i wear a two or four, depending on the designer, and the two fit me perfectly. another reviewer said it's special occasion only, but i like it so much, i'll wear it more often. with that said, it's a wonderful go-to dress for the holiday season.
"I ordered a 6p in this dress so it wld fall above my knees & be slightly smaller than a regular 6. sometimes a regular size 4 works, sometimes a 6. typically a regular size 6 is big on me. i am 5'3"", 118#, 36c. just recd the 6p in the mail. the first thing i noticed is that it's s a knit fabric that looks & feels like polyester although says 'cotton' on the inside label. i think it wld be a bit warm in hot weather, but that is just my observation. the main problem is that it is too big on each s"
I love the colors of this dress, and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time, but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy, but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model, but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough, and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality, but this one is j
I love this dress! tried it on at the store. they only had medium. while i'm usually always a medium, it fit perfectly but pulled at the bust (i'm a 38). i ordered a large online the next day. i have it now and i am extremely pleased. the pattern is unique, the length falls just above the knee and has s sexy flirtiness to it. the back button is key as it gives some contour to the dress. the side pockets are an awesome touch. you can wear this dress any season. i'm wearing it with ankle boots and
"This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p"" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large."
This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!
I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape, i was frustrated that it didn't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head. the fabric was stiff, and seemed to be lace over cotton? not entirely sure. i couldn't get past the feeling off the material.
"Went to the store in search of a butter dish. tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable, versatile and all over appealing this dress is. i'm 5'10"" and the medium hits at my knees.  as always i think the quality could be better. it's not something that will last for years."
"I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big, so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow, what an outfit!!!!
then i washed it according to directions, and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand."
This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable, stylish, and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring, summer, and fall.
"I'm 5'4, 125 lbs, & have a 36 c/d bust; the xs fits great.
i wash everything in cold & line dry... this was no exception. when i took it out of the washer i knew immediately :( i've pulled it back into shape & hung it up, but we'll see.
 dry clean if you want to keep it"
"I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.

i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee"
I love this top, wish they had it in more colors, i would buy more!
I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other
Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.
"This was my first tiny shirtdress purchase after seeing the past few patterns/seasons. for me the last few were a little too busy, but something about both patterns this season felt right for summer. i'm 5'7"", 128# and found my usual s to be too long in length and in sleeve length (the sleeves being a problem that i never have). going to try to exchange for an xs because it really is a lovely piece in both colors (though i slightly prefer the green because it feels more tropical/exotic for summe"
I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short
I purchased this based on previous reviews. the quality of the dress and the print is excellent. the dress fit me perfect in the front however there were so much extra fabric in the back that it made me look extremely large. i understand it's a shirt dress however the back would need to be taken in like 6 inches. for someone who is looking for a more boxy full coverage dress this is more for them
I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!
"I am between a xs and s but figured i would order down based on the reviews. well, it's still huge. i have about 5 inches that i can take in from the side. i have ordered the xxs and am hoping it will look more flattering. i love the colors and design, but as it is it does not do anything for me. for reference i am 124 lbs, 32d, 5'5""."
"The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches,

otherwise, the make is very pretty, i like the texture in the fabric, the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality, but i decided to pass on it, even on sale, since it didn't"
I had my eye on this for a while, and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then, however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite, decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich, and the design is subtle, adn will nto fall apart, so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j
This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.
I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose, body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def
I really loved the colors in this dress and was looking for a long sleeve dress. this style may just be big fitting but the sleeves were way too long and the dress was just shapeless on me. i usually wear a small or a size 4 in clothing and the size small in this dress was way too big. the x-small may have been a better fit but this dress was on backorder and i just received it right before we are going on a trip. there's no time to order the x-small but maybe i can look at it again when we retu
"I love everything about this blouse except for one thing: the peplum just hits way too high up on the body, and i am only 5'4"". 106 and ordered a regular size 2 (not petite) which fits perfectly except for this. it is made of a beautiful textured fabric and is very nice quality. i adore peplums and own many and like the peplum to begin near the waist. however, others may not mind the higher waist and in that case it may work for them. i really hated to send it back it was so pretty but it just w"
Super cute, flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.
I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u
I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and
Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
This top is comfortable and flattering. i really like the simplicity- a wearable basic summer top, with a cute twist, just enough to make it contemporary, but not overstated.
I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6, 128 lbs with some boobs, usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs, and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose, hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy, and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips, plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon
"This dress is comfortable and the pattern is really nice with some good attention to detail on the lace trim and pockets. i ordered this in my usual pxs (i am 5'2""), but this definitely runs very large. it is a shirt style dress so i didn't expect it to be fitted, but off the hanger it was just too shapeless and sack-like for me. i really wanted it to work, so i took it to my tailor and she added a beautiful navy rope-like tie attached to both sides in the back of the dress. it looks amazing, an"
"This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you can't tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri"
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
"I bought this dress in the green. it runs big - i usually take a s and had to return for xs - i am 5'5"" and 125. it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops. worth every penny!!"
"For a brand called ""tiny""--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades, so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--""too big!"", ""too small!""--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty, and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities, just putting them together in a wearable size seems t"
This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!
I love the black and grey version of the vest but decided too try it in plum. the plum color is used only on the lapels and inside of the garment. it has no finished seams but it is like a soft boiled wool so it wouldn't ravel. the seam in the waistline area breaks up the design and adds more interest.
This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.
I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also, it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem, i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.
I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.
This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big, loose and had no shape at all.
Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.
"I feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest. i am 5/9"" and the m'l is the perfect length and size. i was initially attracted by the external seams (and color) and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric. it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy. ."
This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.
I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes, no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve
"This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7"" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight."
Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!
Super thick material and it's lined with cotton so as not to be scratchy on the skin. it looks cute on, hopefully it will soften over time. almost thick like upholstery fabric.
I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec
Love peplums and love this top! the quality and fabric is beautiful. i did have to size up because it ran a little too short on me, but otherwise great top. really cute to pair with a statement necklace as well!
I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.
I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.
"Purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater, and this one was the perfect color. unfortunately i am on the curvier side, with 34g chest, 155lbs 5' 5"", and the med was too big, (i usually wear m or l at retailer.) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type."
I'm not usually a fan of simple crewneck sweaters but this one has some nice added details that make it a keeper. the dark red oxblood color is really nice (it manages to be a red sweater without feeling overly holiday), the detailing at shoulder/chest is interesting yet subtle enough to not be distracting and doesn't feel bulky at all, the dropped shoulder seams are done correctly and without the body becoming boxy. it does feel like it might run a tad bit large, but only very slightly, not eno
I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th
Great coat. love the length but it definitely runs big. i got a m even though i would normally be a l and it's roomy. fabric has pulles under the arms after 1 wear but overall quality is good. very warm. great look for work w. black pants.
"I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8"", typical size 6."
I fell in love with this cute top, however after reading reviews, i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me, sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.
This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(
But if that works for you it is a cute pattern. this is a lighter weight sweater but good for fall.
I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom, but whoa... even when sizing up, i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable, and if you have a smaller bust, it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.
This vest is soft, flattering, and versatile. but both pockets were sewn incorrectly, with broken seams on the bottoms so if you used them, things would fall out. i'm keeping it but had to pay a seamstress to fix it. for the price, i'd expect better quality. recommended conditionally..
This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam, it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+), i would foresee this dress being too snug. however, i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops, but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.
I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though, i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.
I have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small. i'm 5'8, an athletic pear with narrow shoulders, 34c, and usually a 6 in tops at retailer. since the top looks a little short on the model, i sized up to an 8, since i'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer. i'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip, and if it were any smaller, it'd be too tight in my chest. since it doesn't stretch, you need some space for your arms to move. if i could do it again, i'd actually si
"Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3"" 140# 36dd."
Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.
"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great"
"Wanted to love this top, and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place, accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled, although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am, so back it goes. i am 5'7"", 160lbs, 34dddd, and the size large was the correct size."
This is the perfect dress! for summer, fall, winter or spring, it is flattering and looks cute with booties, flip flops, brogues or barefoot! runs a teeny bit large - i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect! i might just buy the other color it comes in!!!!
I bought this top and it ran huge, i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad, i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.
For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.
This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it's really comfortable and fun, too!
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
I usually wear petite which this was not so a little big for me. but nice color and good quality, but pricey for what it is. it's more like a $45 sweater not $100+
"Another reviewer said it best, ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless. 
with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5"", 130, and have a small bust."
I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.
Love this. can be a jacket or blazer syle. fits well.
The colors, style and fit were great. this dress you could wear on many different occasions. all around great piece to own!
I love a good peplum top, and was so excited when it arrived, but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering, because in every other way, it fit like a dream, but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.
"This dress is very striking, especially in the green color way i purchased. flow and loose, very feminine but not ""cute"". well made and very much in style this season. i returned it because it wasn't quite suitable for me-1 size up would have been a better. fit overall."
"I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5"", 112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual."
I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.
"This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3"" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !"
I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua, but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo, but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it), but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size, but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
I absolutely love this tee! i normally don't buy two of the same thing, but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale. i ordered a size small, and it fits tts. it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans/cords. i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best. it's very slimming and so soft.
This tee is amazing! it is so soft and comfortable. and is great for those of us who are tall, it has great length! i went with a medium because i didn't want it too tight. i really hope that retailer restocks soon because i want to buy one in every color!
Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.
This top is much nicer than expected.....the fabric and style are great. i am a size small or medium, and got the small. from the front, it was great. not so much from the back for me. i'm larger on top than bottom and the 5% spandex made it too clingy around the dreaded bra fat area. i don't wear spanx. i wish retailer would be more specific with the fabric content. if i'd known it was 5% spandex, i would have ordered a size medium. i am thinking about doing this because the top is really
This jacket was a gift for my daughter,it fit like a glove and she loved it !
This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale, so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size, what can i say its a simple top, well made and so soft.
I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead, it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.
I love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill! i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance.
"I am 5'10"", 130 pounds. a medium is a perfect fit for me. i love it! not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath, sleeves are long, and it is so, so, so soft. the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing. i am buying one in every color."
Fits great! love soft material. love with skinny jeans brown boots
I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist, kind of straight like a board, and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.
I was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i tried it because of the detail but didn't hold out much hope because it looked frumpy on the hanger. i was very wrong. it fits beautifully. it drapes nicely, hugs the shoulders perfectly and doesn't droop open due to the embellishments. there is a tiny closure where the fabric crosses in the front so you are not exposed. i liked that feature very much. the sleeves are 3/4 on me, but i like it - nice change of pace. this is a very different style
This top feels great on. it just drapes well and isn't clingy. i refused to buy maternity tops, because i wanted to wear the tops after pregnancy. though i bought this top post pregnancy it would have worked great because of the length.
Comfortable casual, hip. i have the black & white color which is a bit thicker than the other colors which i prefer as i recently had a baby and need a little extra fabric. i wish the fabric was a bit softer but the cut is so flattering there was no way i was sending it back. i wish the other colors were in the same thicker fabric and i would have ordered more. my new go to top. the black ribbon on the back is my favorite part.
Great color, soft fabric, but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
I was hoping to find a slimming and cozy sweater, unfortunately this one was baggy and material was really bulky. one of those occasions where i would have never purchased this in person but online you can't quite tell the style and fit. i returned this item.
"I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing... it's a super soft, stretchy, substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering. it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable. i am 5'5"" 120 lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops... i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit. love it so much i bought it in 4 colors... i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation."
This is a beautiful top, however, my top did not match the one in the picture, it's so odd, the stripes are completely different, it's ok, because it's very pretty, but i do like the one pictured better. it's too short on me for leggings and boots, but it's great with skinny jeans. very pretty and soft material.
I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!
"This shirt is amazingly soft and has such a great cut, especially for me being curvy. i love to pair this with cute leggings or tight ankle jeans with my boots. recently wore on a casual date with the hubby and he loved it paired with my dark brown leather jacket and dark jeans. 

only reason i gave it 4 stars was that the shirt tends to stretch out a little at the bottom is seems as you wear it throughout the day - it is still a great shirt and if possible i would buy more. 

need to bring"
"This shirt is pretty but wasn't worth the price in my opinion. the shirt does a pretty decent job of staying closed at least, and the embroidering is pretty, but i could tell the material wouldn't last very long.

also i like my shirts loose fitting, but this one looks more boxy than flowy. i'd probably still buy it if it were cheaper."
This shirt looks and feels fabulous. i got black and white and received a ton of compliments. wore with boots and leggings and fun jewelry.
Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer, it is the most fabulous cut, super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless, i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.
This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this, but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now, and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft, the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!
"I gave this 4 stars instead of five because the picture really does give you the impression that this ""cardigan"" has sleeves but actually it's a cape with a few stitches above the wrist. it's also quite short, i'm only 5 5"" and it hits me above my waist. this picture was clearly shot with the front pulled down, i bet if we saw the back it would be high above her waist. also, one of the buttons fell off the first time i wore it. i heard it fall thankfully so it was easy enough to sew back on but"
I love this top, it's long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up. the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color, not the solids but i still love it! for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am 5'2 125lbs
"I purchased this shell in black. the embellishments and construction of the top are of a good quality, like as shown. i am 5'4"", 120# and typically purchase an xs. this ran a bit bigger than i was expecting from the reviews, but i am overall happy with the top. the center slit may be too revealing for those with a smaller bust."
This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.
Extremely comfortable t. fits tts. bought in black & teal. can be dressed up with a scarf or worn with just jewelry. fairly lightweight so probably not a good choice for cold winter months. great price too!
Excellent tunic tee. will be great with leggings or jeans, which is just what i was hoping.
I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me, but i'm between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!
So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress
The fit and feel of this top is lovely. great shirt to layer. fits great, i get compliments every time i wear it.
"Beautiful detail, soft drapey fabric. but it pulls funny from where they added stitching at the top of the v. for me it was also a little short but i have a long torso. i'm 5'7"" 155lbs and the size medium fit nicely with the exception of the length."
I really love this dress but am deciding whether to keep it because, while it fits well in the skirt and around my torso, it is tight in the arms. i can't really lift my arms above should height. the plus is that it would keep me from bidding too much at my kid's school auction. the negative is that it would be hard to dance in.
"Was really looking forward to this sweater, but it's not a cardigan, it's a poncho. i can't decide if it's fun-quirky or just odd. it's gorgeously made, and extremely soft, but i do wish it was actually sleeves. i haven't decided if it's something i will wear or not. my husband referred to it as ""batwings."" that should have been depicted in one of the photos."
I read the previous comments and was skeptical. i love the dress! it's fitted on the top and flowy on the bottom. i didn't find it too big or maternity on the bottom half. the print is really pretty with flecks of blue that brightened up the dress.
"I purchased my wife this shirt for christmas and she loved it! the quality of the shirt is amazing and now she wants them in every color! even though she says she's kidding, i really know that she isn't.! :#

the information i fill out #below) is about my wife, not me!"
This is such an incredible jacket. total show stopper and well worth the investment.
I tried this on at the store and had to buy this dress. it's adorable on and the fabric is really soft. very flattering too!
After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.
"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit"
This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave, or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau
I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
This dress is one of the most beautiful dresses i have seen. purchased for my daughter . . . it was as if you made this dress for her. had to return it because the woven fabric was fraying around the back v neckline and zipper. was able to replace it, the replacement looks good -- have a concern about two areas but we will see. just love the lines and fit of this dress! truly hope the fabric holds up.
Like the previous reviewer stated, it's more like a cape. i'd to call it a cape-digan. style: super comfy, loose fit for comfort. fabric: high quality, just right thickness (not too thick, not too thin), snuggly soft, doesn't pill with wear. design: totally retailer cute and quirkiness, top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity, and the sleeve has sheep and a fence (how cute is that!). this is a very versatile sweater, goes with everything, and so comfortable that i reach for
"Currently own this in 5 colors after originally buying one. i'm 5'10"" normally wear a medium, bought a small in this. best material and fit overall, perfect length for long torso"
"This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff, and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge.
.
got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2"", currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s.

the one i got in the mail"
I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.
"I ordered these joggers in holly size m. for reference, i am 5'5, 138 lbs, i have a small waist with *thicker* thighs and bum. i was worried that these would make all my ""flaws"" stand out as so many joggers in the past have, but these are not that way at all! they are so comfy and just right! they could easily be dressed up or down. these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new, more stylish twist!"
I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.
This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick, it is soft, and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my
I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different, awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy, athletic build, with broad shoulders and small waist, for your reference.
"Love this top!!
great colors and fits great
reasonably priced"
This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size, however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs, ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!
This dress caught my eye in the store. it's lovely! i don't think i would've ordered it (it's hard to see the charm in the photo), but i tried it on because the colors are so pretty and the fabric has vintage look/feel, and i couldn't pass it up on sale. i usually wear a 6, but i bought an 8 because the saleswoman said the sleeves run small and there isn't any stretch in the fabric. both are true. i tried on both dresses in that size, because of color placement and to check on the sleeve size. b
I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion. i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it. the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath, but i think it's adorable. don't be scared away by the review below!
"This sweater is actually so cute on, i had no idea, nut decided to try it on, since it was on sale. what a msitake, i had to actually buy it!

the grey part is very soft and warm, the design part is nice and
flattering. nothing wrong with this sweeater!

note: i a,m petite (5 foot 1.5 inches) and decided to buy the regular size for longer length..."
I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived, i thought it was a cute, different top, uniquely designed. when i tried it on, it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately, it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect
"I am returning this dress as it looks pretty matronly once it's on. the top was also very tight in the arms and chest (i am 5'9"", 140lbs, and 34d)."
Love this sweater. bought this with the matching leggings. couldn't be more comfortable. cozy fabric. cute details. loving them both. please bring more of the same in different colors, patterns.
I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.
So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!
I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n
"I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i wasn't crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i don't really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale."
I love the versatility of this top. i feel like i can wear it with anything to dress it up or down.
"I am usually a 32a. i ended up with a 34 b based on sales assoc input and what was available. the 32 gave me back fat ( i do not have back fat) so she said the 34 would be better, it ran small etc. the 34 also fit ( had to be ordered and mailed) but it still gave me ""flab"" over the back band. comparing it to my other regular bras, i can see that the band has too thin fabric and rolls and has ""harder edges"" compared to wider , thicker band on my other bras. very pretty but i will be returning. sa"
"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos."
I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.
I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it, it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly!
This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!
"I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3"", i love the length."
Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute, it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
This multi-season dress fits beautifully, the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight, drape and swing to it. the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but it's probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer.
I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.
I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.
"The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.

the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress."
Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure, and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear."
I love this dress, although the darting is terrible. the colors are much richer in person, it's a beautiful dress for events and has a nice weight so it doesn't feel too flimsy (since it is not lined). i really love the length of the sleeves and the swish of the skirt. however, the darting makes your bust have two little triangles- i really wish i could reseam the darting as it's a bit strange looking.
Looks great with skinny jeans, leggings, trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.
This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful, vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty, swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs, but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly, the arms were cut too tight, the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.
Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.
"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!"
"I purchased this dress off the reviews.unfortunately i have to return it. i expected it to fit as they said. i am 5'1'- 120 lbs. 35/b-c. i got the s petite. i could not even get this dress on over my chest. the waist was on top of my chest. 
i really was disappointed . the material is so soft, i would have had to purchase a m in a regular to fit me. and it would have looked terrible on me. so, i would say, for a tall thin girl , yes , a short girl a no. and i am very petite."
This dress has become a favorite in my rotation. the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist. the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories.
Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!
"I am 5'3"" 130lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly. the dress hugs my figure nicely. 
unfortunately, i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work, at least for my own comfort level, but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date. i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress."
Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!
"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10"", and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model, and the cut was just too wide under the armpits."
Loved the fit of these jeans and the fading but the ripping was too much for me at my age. i normally wear petite but since these are mid rise ankle just ordered in 27 regular. so the ripping was right at my knee and did not like that.
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs)
"I ordered my usual xs petite, and it fit like a glove (115lbs, 5'1.5""). the v cut a little low, making this dress almost too sexy for work. cut is extremely flattering, and the coloring being so neutral is a step away from basic lbd. the length was pefect. material is stretchy, amking this slim fit comfortable."
This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut, but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me, so had to go back.
Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!
I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.
I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.
Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however, like others have commented, it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.
"I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/4 from bottom of collar (the collar adds 1 1/4"") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front."
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly."
"First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. 


what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin"
The top fits nice, but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.
Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.
Tried the xs on in store from an online return, loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned, it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned, the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.
"Okay, i love the blouse this brand has in the same material, so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7"" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this, usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist, and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose, and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my"
Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so
I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!
I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits, but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it, but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit, i will be returning this dress.
"This dress seems quite high quality and is wonderfully designed, except in the chest. the wrap style hugs in all the right places but the chest. i'm slightly large chested (34c/d) but can usually wear a size small or size 4 in dresses and tops (5'5"", 122 lbs). the small in this dress was great everywhere else, but i couldn't breathe and it totally flattened out my chest. also, it is quite low cut, so another mark against it for anyone with a semi-large bust. couldn't wear it to work that reason"
I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality. (after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment.) i couldn't be more thrilled with this choice! it is so flattering on, beautiful color and cut. the only complaint i have is slightly minor, and it's in relation to the hidden bac
I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one."
"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease, modern look, and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years), but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt, and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.
"I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3"" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light."
First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.
Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!
I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.
Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock,under my arm, which could be seen, i guess, if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next, who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top, i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
"This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!
i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!
i wish they had other colors!!!!!!"
"Love this vest- it's so chic and pairs with so much.  i have it in the army green and it's prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top.   it's great.   i am about 5'2"" and an typically a small top-  the small was much to big but the xs was perfect. i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain. i am very happy with my purchase!"
Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these!
I saw this in my local retailer styled with a tank top underneath and i fell in love and bought the combo right away. it is a vest, so it's not meant to be fitted, so i think sizing down is fine. i'm usually an xs/s in tops, i went with the xs in this, and j still get that relaxed look which is nice. this vest is great, very versatile, simple yet adds great style. it was a bit of a splurge for me but i'm happy i added it to my closet!
I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous, the fabric feels a bit weird, kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length, and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!
"I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3"" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the"
"I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.

the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &"
Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took"
I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size
I have the white lemon lace shirt and love it so i was excited to see it in a color well suited for fall. the peacock pattern on the blouse i received is perfect and the pattern is well placed. i do love this one as much as the lemon blouse, however, the color is not the same as it appears online. it is more of a jade green color, and although it's pretty, i would have preferred it to look more of a blue color. i'm keeping it, as it is still an unusual and elegant blouse that's cute with dark sk
"I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.

sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size."
I don't if it is me, but usually i am a solid size 6, occasionally an 8.  i had to size up to a 10! the wool is very light, and while it is a weird texture, it isn't scratchy. i liked how the skirt was styled at the store...looks better than it does in the photos online.
I bought this in green and i absolutely love it! the quality of material is very fantastic, a durable fabric that will hold up well over time. its a good quality too, so can be dressed up somewhat, and also does well as a very casual piece. love it!
Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.
Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!
Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.
I love love this top and bought it in both colors. it runs a tad big but fits me well. both l and xl fit me well, but the xl was longer so i have one in each size. i really like this top. it looks good, goes well with most pants especially blue, and is very comfortable. i am very happy with my purchase.
I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
I always love the arielle jeans. every color seems to be slightly different in the fit, but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting. to echo the other reviews, the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own. i have a fairly straight, athletic shaped body and went with my 'larger' size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit. the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr
Bought these today at the denver store (nice peeps at cc!). anyway, i feel in love. the style is simple, free and easy for summer and the neutral color is lovely in person. so glad i bought these...now i have something to wear to work tomorrow :)!
Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
The fabric is too sheer, also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe, but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft, cozy, and cute, though.
This dress is really fun and easy to wear all winter. the colors are really easy to pair and like the last reviewer mentioned, i love the sheer sleeves. i was very worried about the comfort of the fabric because most sweater dresses always fail. this dress is extremely comfortable to wear. it is not scratchy at all. it is soft and comfortable for winter even indoors with the building's heat blasting away. the dress will fit the size you normally wear, however it may show lumps and bumps. i would
I'm a 32dd, so i wouldn't normally wear a bralette out of the house (not enough support). this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable. i'm probably going to get at least one more. for reference, i'm a 32dd (small back, big boobs) and a small fit me extremely well.
When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that
"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up, but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable, warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size, i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!"
"I have to say being a silk lover, decision was hard to make. the quality is phenomenal. i do agree to a reviewer that said it's pj like. i tried it with belt, didn't help much with the look somehow. it just felt empty. my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said ""ewww, grandma""... i know, truth hurts.

i can't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement. on top of that, the background is more peachy tha"
This ia very pretty dress. however, it is a unique design. i like the design of the dress, but i can see where some may not. i can't see a younger person wearing this. it is more for an older woman. the dress is so soft, does wrinkle easily, but just a beautiful pattern and comfortable. i can see some of my friends thinking this is too much like a nightgown, but i really love this dress!
"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size, but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric, although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it."
I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute, but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.
"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy, it was too flimsy, the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough, just didn't flow very well."
This robe is warm, soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!
I absolutely love this jacket! i bought it and wore it to work to next day, and received tons of compliments! it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot. i am 5 5 119 pounds and xs fit a well.
Cute, cool dress for hot summer days. very roomy. has pockets!
I bought this for the office and received many compliments about it. it puts the outfit together just right and the material is very comfortable. it fits my need for comfortable clothing that still looks good enough for a business setting. this jacket is more comfortable (almost slouchy) than it is structured.
I'm not in love with this, but the husband thinks it looks cute and the sale price isn't bad so i'm keeping it. i got it in s, and am usually an xs or s in retailer tops (34b, 26 inch waist, 120lbs). if i had gone with xs it probably would've been too tight in the shoulders. however i could be 6 months pregnant and you wouldn't know it. it is very boxy in the torso, and i realize the design is for it to be flowy, as the back is partially split. but it looks relatively fitted on the model, which is
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously, this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7"" frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl"
Love the lines of this tweed look jacket. pockets are a definite plus, as is the soft pleat in the back. this is a good piece to transition from winter to spring. it updates your jeans and soft t-shirt look.
"The ""peachy"" color read as pretty gold on me, which i think was good for my pale skin and sandy hair. the lavender accent color is also very nice. forgiving fit, elegant fabric, pretty print, respectable hemline, super flattering neckline, love the pockets... all in all, i think this dress is a nice choice for day events."
This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li
I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall, it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
"Nice quality, soft fabric, sleeves definitely make a unique statement. the fit worked for me, although it could have more room in hips (for my hourglass figure). got m, size l was way too big. i am 34d, but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest. the color are my favorites in this season.
wear it to stand out!"
It really is a beautiful sweater.  the material is super soft and feels luxurious.  unfortunately, it just looked too bulky on me and accentuated my width.  maybe if i were taller, i could pull it off.
This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned
I love this piece, it fits well and is comfortable. you can dress it up or be more casual. i have received many compliments already and it goes with many of my outfits.
I wore this dress to nyc on a date. it was perfect...light, flowy, and lovely. the peach and green combination is really pretty, and i love the hemline, which is longer in the back than in the front. i can only say one thing: as i was walking down the street with my boyfriend, a total stranger (and not a crazy person) came up to us and told us we looked beautiful. enough said.
Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight, can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs, folding the collar, wrapping or unwrapping, etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized, it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.
I was expecting not to fit into this because i'm womanly, and generally wear a size 16 in things. but the picture was so gorgeous i had to try. i'm so happy i did. it slipped right on and is flowy yet not overly so. it still has shape. the colors are exactly as it is portrayed on the site. i love having this in my closet!
Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!
I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
Only the xxs was left, so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference, i'm 32c, 5'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color, along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable, too. love so much i, ordering more!
"This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw"
"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6"", 32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining, and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty, but not much else."
Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.
I wanted to fall in love with this jacket! i'm an xs or s in retailer brands so i ordered this online in both sizes. when i received it i felt the fabric and immediately loved the color and texture. creamy white (not too stark) and so incredibly soft! the length was the same as on the model which is what i wanted because being 5'2 113# many jackets swallow me. i have narrow shoulders and unfortunately this jacket was too broad and puffy for my frame, and i looked like a marshmallow. the xs was the
"Got these shorts in both colors: the blue-gray and the red-pink. super lightweight in hot humd weather, and keeps a crisp shape (doesn't get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do). really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depth.
.
if you're between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day. i got these in a size 2 and they get a little loose on my 33""-25""-37ish"" frame. i'm 5'2"" and the petite was sold out, so i don't know if t"
Beautiful shorts, good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you!
This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however, it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly, this is a deal breaker for me.
I absolutely love this top. it has a very classy look and can be used casual or dressy. i get lots of compliments.
"I bought this dress in red for a wedding. i love the laser-cut design and the fit overall is good except, as another reviewer wrote, the psuedo-empire waste is likely not awesome for anyone with an average to longer torso. i have a super long torso and the dress still works, but a lower waist would have taken it from good to ""wow"". love the innovative take on a classic silhouette/design, though (and the red is gorgeous)."
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
"I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and"
"I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress, but not a major deterrent.

i'm 5'6"" and about 145lbs, and the size 6 (my usual retailer size) was perfect."
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!
I love this blouse on the model online. however, i couldn't get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me. did not like the glittery thread.
I really wanted to love this dress. the cut out design is beautiful and it is very feminine. however, it does not really cut in at the waist and it left me feeling a bit boxy. i think if it cinched at the waist, it would be perfect. it didn't work out for me, but i think on the right girl, it would be very cute.
This dress is perfect! i just bought it yesterday in store for a wedding i'm going to next spring. i got it in red, which is normally not a great color for me, but it's a darker red so it works. i love anything with cutouts so i was drawn to it immediately. i normally wear a 10 in a dress to accommodate my (rather wide) shoulders, and the 10 fit well. i can see it working for a variety of occasions. one big plus is the quality--this isn't even remotely flimsy.
Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.
I'll be wearing this to holiday parties this year. pretty, fashionable, not fussy.
"I ordered this dress, along with several others, for an upcoming wedding. this was my favorite of all of them as far as style; unfortunately it just didn't fit. i'm 5'2"" 116lbs and my regular size 2 was slightly too long, the waist a bit too low, the shoulders a tad too wide. as a result it hung on me like on a hanger. i guess i would need a petite but alas does not appear to come petite..."
I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.
I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!
This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath, and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out, and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned, the quality could be slightly better, but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.
What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.
"I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful, i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like"
"I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a"
Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!
"I bought this in the blue stripe and the color is not what is shown at all! the photo shows a bright, vibrant blue and white stripe top. i got a white and very light pastel blue stripe top. so disappointed because the top doesn't have that wow look as shown in the photo. however, it goes well with blue jeans even in the lighter shade of blue.

and, the fabric is nice and cool for hot summer days. the fit is tts. i bought a 16 and if you wear an 18 this will fit also. i didn't find this too box"
I love the sparkled fabric and intricate design on the back. i had trouble with the front because the cowl exposed a bit too much, so i wore a tank top underneath. ordering a petite may have helped with the cowl.
The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,
"I didn't mind the ""scratchiness"" others proclaimed this garment had, but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back. looks great from the front, but uncomfortable."
"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!"
"I knew i had to have this shirt when i saw it online. the embroidery is almost like english smocking. i was not disappointed when i opened my package. the only flaw i've noticed is that it does ""pucker"" slightly around the shoulders and chest area due to the tight embroidery not allowing it to stretch. it is not terribly noticeable though. lovely shirt all around."
Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip
It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin
It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous, however, ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi
I was really hoping this dress would work out, as it looks like it could be a staple outfit for work! the material is very nice, but unfortunately the dress was way too big. there is a band right under the chest that i would think should be somewhat fitted to give the dress some shape to your figure, but it was wayyy to big on me (especially considering i am large-chested! i will be returning this.
"I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9"", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well."
"This dress is too short for me to wear as a dress, at 5'7"" and over 40. however is is great with leggings and boots.
it drapes nicely not over sized like many dresses this style. the color is more earthy than pictured. it's actually nicer in person than online. and it has a wonderful texture to it. i was drawn to it when i walked in the store they had it on display under s short cropped jacket and boots."
I loved this coat in the picture, and couldn't wait to get it. sadly, it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small, and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves, and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape, and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs, but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable, and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
"This is a really cute and flattering dress on me. i am 5'4"" 120 lbs and the 4 is a perfect fit. i am a little busty but the empire seam brings the dress back in slightly below my chest so it does not tent out.the asymmetrical hem makes it really flowy when you walk. the under dress is a lightweight fabric in a sheath cut that is shorter than the over dress which is a fun detail. the over dress material is somewhat gauzy and it moves as you move. the pockets are positioned in the front which is a"
I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin
"Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!"
I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
"I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.
the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart, i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides, it looks a bit too long (well, i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).
the material looks faded, not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style, but this"
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.
I found the material a little stiff, im asummig linen is stiff at first. i got an xxs and fit tts in my case (34 b, 5'7, 120 lb).
This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however, the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.
Love the colors and pattern. i am normally a m/l. i ordered a large as that's all they had in stock and it fits fine though the medium would probably have fit a little better for me. it is very long, even for me and i'm 5' 9.
First, i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next, i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite, and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally, the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes, but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric, both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms, 2 buttons popped off!
It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough, there is a slip underneath.
This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty.  love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move.  very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.
The colour is gorgeous but it's basically a baby doll dress - it looks like the waist is much lower on the model but for my height and large chest it' fell like a baby doll or a maternity dress. not flattering. pockets are a nice touch though.
This dress is gorgeous yet sturdy, it is all about the lace. size regular 4 fit my chest area well and i like the midi look (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). whether regular or petite size, when i walked or turned, the pleats added too much volume and looked overwhelming and no shape. i tried it with a belt and it looked better, but looked odd because the pleats poofed at the belt area. i tried with a sweater, jacket...then finally gave up. it would look gorgeous on a tall thin gal.
This dress is modern yet timeless, cute yet rock and roll if worn with boots. i am 36b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size regular s fits well. i like regular size because it is longer in the torso (lengthens waist for a belt) and the length is right above the knees, appropriate for work. the bust area fits me perfectly so well-endowed ladies may want up a size. i am into grey now but all colors are gorgeous, love the sheen, colors are true like shown (1 star off for hi price for a simple dress).
"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting, so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight, but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath, which adds a nice touch.  great length, not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"", 124 lbs, and 32b."
"I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too ""bridey?"" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon ""center."" the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f"
I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it!
"This dress arrived today, and it is both flattering and comfortable. i am just a smidge under 5'4"", and i ordered a regular xs. in the front, it hit me about 3"" above the knee. it is office appropriate for a business casual environment. the red was deeper in color than i expected (it seemed a little ""brighter"" on my monitor), but this is no problem for me; it is still a great color. i tried it with clogs, knee boots and ankle boots - all really cute. and, as and added bonus, it looks good with b"
I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model, but unfortunately for me, it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model, but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated, gorgeous dress - just not on me.
Love the dolman sleeves and its the perfect length. throw on a cute necklace and go.
This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!
Beautifully fitting. simple and flattering. i am an athletic size 8/10. the 10 fits well but the straps may have to be taken in a little.
What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!
"This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look, but i love this design! it is beautiful and seems to be very well made. i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high (it comes to my waist, but i don't think it is a problem. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b. the xs works well for me."
Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!
These are by far the sexiest fitting overalls ever! they are lengthening and flattering and comfy at the same time!
This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.
This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room, or i would not have seen it. i tried it on, and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big, and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago, when just about everything in the store was truly unique.
I am so pleased with this tunic. the fabric heavy enough to wear through winter, and it is very flattering. the colors are as pictured, as well. as another reviewer mentioned, the slit is high. but it still works perfectly with leggings or mid to high rise skinny jeans.
"I just purchased this velvet top in my regular size small (34-27-35) so i'd say it runs tts and i couldn't be happier! the designer, moulinette soeurs is one of my very favorites here at retailer and always seems to come through for me when i need something really special. it's is a vintage style top that reminds me of something miss fisher from ""miss fisher's murder mysteries,"" the ""downton abbey"" ladies or the designer sisters from ""the house of eliott"" would wear and that's a major compliment."
Retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint. i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants. the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you can't tell by looking at the photo. i didn't mind it and thought it was actually a plus! i just think it is a bit too expensive, because although it is nice quality, i don't feel it is worth the price tag. pretty
While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.
I saw a review from another petite person who said this runs small, but i'm my case it ran true to size. it's a very flattering dress and easy to wear for any occasion.
I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.
"First, let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1"", 138lbs, 34dd, 30, 38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve, esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6. 

first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips. 

the bad: surprisingly, the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f"
I picked this dress up off the rack on a whim, and did not expect to love it. i was so delightfully surprised! this dress is made of a lovely, thick, starchy cotton--i found i didn't require a bra. which is great because the back is a gorgeous feature of the dress. the white band across the midsection makes the waist appear small. the dress has sort of a retro feel with the tea length and looks best with heels. i did note a little bit of gaping under my arms but not enough to keep me from buying
"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on"
The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest, it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model, so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
Very chic version of a turtleneck/tunic. material more substantial than i expected. ultimately it wasn't really flattering on my body type but otherwise i would absolutely recommend.
This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft), the flowers, the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!
I have never written a review on retailer before, but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online, i felt i had a duty to review it. it is gorgeous! i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it. the fabric is light pink with a shimmer. the flower detailing is so feminine and soft. the back's closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing. i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!
I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.
"This tunic was a surprise - the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic. however, i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it's pretty wide, better if it was a 1/4 or 1/2 inch less. fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice.

i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled!
sadly returning."
I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)
I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o
These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic, but ultimately decided to return.
I usually wear a small, 4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.
I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
"Oh my, i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 25 waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5"" and the length is good too, not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class, sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!"
"I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8"", hourglass, 135 lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!"
I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs., 34b, and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but wasn't at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews, i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however, i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half, thereby making me look larger than i am, so i sent it back. otherwise, this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein"
Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, it's flattering for us curvier ladies,
I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. i'm between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six, but it's definitely tight. i have a larger chest, and it's pretty low and sexy, though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. i've also put shirts under it and it's a super cute jumper. i'm 5'1 and the dress (regular, not petite) hits right below my knee.
I?ve been looking at this dress online for some time now, but i?ve been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat. it just did not seem right. but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it. it is a wonderfully soft, linen dress. it is a bit tight in the midriff, so i had to size up a bit. i usually wear a size 2, but went with size 4 this time. size 4 fit perfectly. it is comfortable, easy to wear, just the right amount of sexy. it will be a nice every day dress for summer i
Love this dress. i have it in white. just washed it in cold water in the machine and it still looks like new. very cute and comfortable. i stitched up the slit a bit, i am older, but otherwise, perfect.
These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.
I'm really excited that retailer is selling basics. i love the flow of this fabric and it does not cling. i haven't worn them yet but they'll be perfect for work. i look forward to trying on the other essential styles.
Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
"The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric... 
however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears."
"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine."
This dress is tricky. the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small. i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath. the fabric is a very thin linen. my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro. its very light and cool perfect for the summer time.
"This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me, but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.
if they had additional colors, i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect."
Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i'm a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up.
I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts, half tucked, and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering, it is a tiny bit sheer, but i was wearing a magenta bra, so perhaps i am biased. overall, i think this is a good basic addition, to a summer wardrobe, can be worn with a nice skirt, or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs, can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs, with 30dd chest.
I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
"I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a ""crop top"""
Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.
Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.
"When this dress first showed up online, i liked it, but didn't buy it because i wasn't in love. retailer weekend popped up, so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first ""off the shoulder"" dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up, no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy."
"This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3"" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!"
I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.
Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!
This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it's very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.
I feel slim and comfortable in these cute trousers.  got compliments at work.   they are definitely more of a work pant, due to the material.  i think i could wear them outside of work (look-wise), but maybe wouldn't feel as comfortable in them after the hours of nine-to-five, due to the material.
Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.
This dress is so versatile. great summer wear!
Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.
"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"
"I bought these pants in yellow for an event where i had to wear yellow. i was weary about the color but it is so great in person. it's a very bright lemon-y yellow. they're high waisted and very flattering. i'm 5'11"" and normally wear a 30 and they were a little too large but nothing a tight belt couldn't fix. they also hit a little bit above the ankle which initially i was worried about with the flare but it actually was a really cool look. i received so many compliments that day and am glad to"
Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!
Love the bright colors! made really well!! super soft and vibrant!
This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.
I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!
I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
"Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.

i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.

i do wish they came in more colors."
Love this sweater! it feels so soft and it slides right on over the head and neck. easy to wear. this is my favorite sweater. i wear it all the time. the lilac is a really nice subtle color as well. meant to be roomy.
I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.
I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack, in a moss green color. the material, cut, and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26, and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items, they cost $42 + tax.
I got these in kelly green because i am tired of all of the black and navy in my wardrobe, and i was not disappointed. the pants are well-designed and drape well. unlike a previous reviewer, i did not find the fabric to be cheap, but it is light and a little blousy--not bad for a warm region like mine. this polyester fabric has two advantages: no fading and no wrinkles. a good staple for work.
"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future."
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i am usually a petite, so i knew it would hit me just above the ankle, but it works! what is lacking from the description is the under slip that comes with the dress. it is a knee length, cotton jersey slip that is bulky and uncomfortable - thus the 4 star rating instead of 5 star. i won't use the slip, so this makes the dress fairly sheer when backlit. otherwise, the dress is well made and the addition of the piping at the seams makes it special. i
"Tried them on in store. they were actually kind of sexy on. i have an hourglass figure and the way that these fit, felt sort of like a 50's/60's fit, accentuating and flattering my shape. 
on my to get list."
"I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9"" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front, which i don't like, as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen, they will require frequent ironing (which, i hate to do in the summer)."
I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.
I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.
Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.
I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.
I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.
The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!
"I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the ""red"" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!"
This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons! the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely!
So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.
I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in
This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.
I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me, the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
This is a beautiful skirt. it is exactly as pictured. the colors are bright and vibrant and the skirt is very full as expected. i feel like it does run a bit small. i'm usually an 8 in skirts and dresses and bought a 10. it was a bit snug at the waist but not too tight so i decided to keep it for now. my one complaint is the horrible noise that the skirt makes with my every movement. anyone and everyone can hear you coming from a mile away. the skirt is beautiful but a little stiff as well. i do
This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!
Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!
There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!
"I love this coat! i purchased the size 6. i am a size 6 petite, but they were out. plus i wanted the coat to be a little longer. i wasn't a fan of how high it was on the model. it fit as i expected. i will have to take up the arm length, and it hit a little longer than it did on the model. i am 5' 120 pounds. 34c

the quality is what i expected. it's excellent with lining. color is as shown. this coat will go with everything! i plan to dress it up and down. i purchased the ""orange"" pants and the"
As other reviewers said, this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big, ordered a size down, & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally, i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra
I bought this dress for an awards ceremony, and couldn't be more pleased. the quality and detailing on the dress are great, and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on. i love that it's machine washable on a delicate setting. i've already worn it twice, and can't wait to wear it again for easter.
This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.
"This dress is lovely. the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors. the material is sturdy. the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust. the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the 6 regular even though i am only 5'4"". the pockets are a bonus!"
This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.
"Cute black t-shirt that runs absolutely huge 
i ordered  the extra small  because the extra extra small  was sold out 
 the extra small  was not even close to fitting 

 so disappointing very cute t-shirt for very big people do not buy if your petite"
"This is the perfect dress for going out and wearing to work (with a jacket or sweater and boots). it fits perfectly across the bust and waist and then has enough room to glide over the hips.
the material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful. my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well."
I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.
I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.
I'm usually a 2-4 in retailer dresses and i was surprised how well the 2 fit. i like that the dress is navy instead of black, which makes it even prettier.the embroidery is very nice without being too much to wear for more casual activities. fabric is thick enough for wearing out in autumn with some tights and a sweater. prettier in person.
This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice, the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
"I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick, it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews, i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch, and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic, i was not surprised by the ""brightness"" of it like othe"
Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store, it looked more navy than black, but as i have it home, it is definite
I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.
I wore this dress to work with a tan pair of booties and the compliments started upon entry and did not stop till the end of the day. very feminine and comfy all at once.
The dress is too loose and runs too big
"I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6"" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt, a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the"
I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!
This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.
So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.
Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
I was hoping this top would be a nice architectural piece to add to my wardrobe with its straight black line accents. sadly, in the end, it is just a t-shirt. a large t-shirt. i ordered my normal size (medium) and this shirt ran more like a large. i also did not like the way the neck was hemmed. the fabric folds over itself, when i think a better design would have been a more simple hem. i ended up returning this item due to its size.
I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight, and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b
"I'm about 5'9"" and this sweater was too short for me. the arm length was great but the overall length was just too short :-( i'll be returning this one."
This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.
"I purchased this to wear in spring and summer for work or in the evening. i am 5'8"" and have actual measurements of 29"" ribcage and 33"" at largest part of my bust. i wear a 32c/d bra. i found this dress fit me perfectly in the bust and the darts on the front create a flattering shape. i was disappointed in the waist at the back. from the photos, it is not clear that there is a drawstring waist cord. i thought this made the back look bunchy. i would have much preferred a side zip so the back coul"
Love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure, love the colors anything goes with it, and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town
I saw this in the store, not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.
I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality, so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!
This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!
The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top.
A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.
I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s.
I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft, comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.
These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string, which ended up working out, but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites, but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts, as th
Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.
"I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue."
Wow great soft feels great but not too clingy. only thing keeping from 5 start is that it will pill some. the sleeves are not fuzzy so they don't pill but body will/does.
"The dress is lovely and fits true to size. i like the petite fit. i would note, however, the dress length does not match the description. the description states the dress falls 45"" from shoulder. i measured it at 40 inches. it is definitely shorter than i was expecting."
I'm normally a size 25p. i bought these in a 26 because i wanted a more relaxed fit. i could barely pull them up over my calves. i could get them on and button them, but i felt like a sausage stuffed into a straw. size up 2 sizes at least!
"This little number is really cute, i got it on sale, after i looked at it, went home, slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0
i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work, or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear."
Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school
"I'm 5'10"" and have athletic legs. these jeans are so comfy, long enough, and look good on the booty. the photo is deceiving as they are much longer. i wish they carried more colors. it's hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these."
Love the tee but it is very thin. best for layering
This shirt fits great. normally wear an xs or a small and a small fits in this. comfortable and cute on. i wish i had ordered the other color as well.
I purchased this sweater in my usual xs, but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff, too, so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also, the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small, but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it."
The first reviewer was right about this dress--checked her review before buying it. it's a beautiful creation and perfectly designed, and it's also slimming. i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt, but it is fine. highly recommended.
I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik
It's really a casual tee, but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color, it can have a little more dressed to go out look. i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture, but has a nice flattering flow. a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale.
Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!
I don't normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it. really well made and quite unique. i reckon i'll get a lot of use out of it,
I probably wouldn't have even tried this on in the store, but i took a chance when it was on sale. i put it on and it was immediate love. the fit is perfect. i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large. it is not boxy, but not too tight either. it feels well made.
So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.
Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.
I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.
"Ok, if i had a different body, this would be awesome but i have a big butt and meaty thighs so just did not flatter me. although my husband couldn't tell that the pants were tugging on me (thanks to the pattern it does camouflage), it was uncomfortable. so if you are built like me, this isn't the jumpsuit for you. 

this is a well made garment but there is no give in the butt and thigh area (hence would not recommend for my thick thighed sisters). 

for reference, i am 5'3 and 150 pounds. th"
This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.
I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on. 

i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4"", the petite is the way to go. however, i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a"
Nicely structured, yet soft blazer. wardrobe staple. runs true to size. i would buy all colors, but restrained myself to the black/green.
"I'm 5'8"" about 134, somewhat of a pear, and these jeans in size 28 fit like they were made for me. plus, the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color. ankle opening is more straight than skinny, which is a change from my usual skinny jeans, but i like it."
"I agree with the other reviewer, this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.

___________
pros:
- not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend, making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.
- soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.
- lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.
- ran tts. i'm 5'9, hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.
___________
cons:"
Unfortunately this piece has a very boxy cut and the white layer is stiff and billows out - i am tall and thin but this made me look pregnant - very unflattering. i considered trying a smaller size, but i did not like the material too much either so i just returned it.
This skirt is so beautiful!! it's a bit small, but only a tad. i can still wear it, and it encourages me to lose 5lbs haha! i get compliments everywhere i go.
Great jeans in a lovely shade of grey. they are longer than shown in the picture, however, which i love. i haven't worn mine yet, and i wonder how stretched out they'll get, but overall the fit is quite flattering.
"I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!"
Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.
I purchased this on a whim and i'm so glad i did. this is a gorgeous piece. fabric is soft very feminine and stylish. quality is outstanding. it can be worn with a dress or jeans. lovely shades of pink and soft gray. i live in florida, so it's a bit heavy for hotter weather, but will be great on a cool spring day. love it!
I love this blazer because it feels like a sweater but has the formal structure of a blazer. great for fall!
"I bought the blue dress, though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.

i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge), but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller. 

i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual, which is what i wanted, but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty."
I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!
This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size, and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
This is definitely a personal preference review. i loved this dress when i tried it on. it's really beautiful. however, there was just way too much fabric on the sleeves for me. i know it's the style and i have similar style dresses, but i felt really large in this dress and it all came down to the sleeves for me.
In the photo, this sweater is very appealing but in person very disappointing. i am 5'7, always take a size medium but on me, the sleeves were far too long and the sweater just didn't fit properly. the collar doesn't fold right in the front and it hangs awkwardly. if you try to use the button, it stretches and looks terrible. in the back, it falls short. it's going back.
This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.
"As soon as i opened the package, i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5"" and 128lb, ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3"
"I popped into retailer the other day just to look around, and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first, then i saw the cut and style, and fell in love! they only had xs and s, and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous, i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely, and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large, but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very ""peasant princess"" feel to"
I have never bought the mother brand before, but at close to 200$ i was expecting something fabulous. at size 29 (my usual) i couldn't even get them on my leg. i can't imagine how many sizes i'd need to go up to even get them to fit!
It's the perfect sweatshirt! super comfortable, but also cute! i am 5'4'' and 125 pounds, and the size 0 fits perfectly.
I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq
I love the details of this top: the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering, especially if you have a tummy. the arm holes aren't gaping like so many tops, so you don't even need a cami underneath to hide your bra. it is a bit on the larger side. i often wear a large, but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small.
This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!
"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs. i ordered an xs. it hits at my knees and is not see through. the color is pinkish in person which i like more than the photo."
"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back."
I absolutely love this top.....the color, style, fit..everything! i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium. i have had so many compliments wearing this top. it is very feminine, flows nicely, hangs well. love the color. can't recommend this enough!
Love this casual and soft flowing top. its a nice loose fit. slightly big, however i'm petite. asymmetrical hem adds a unique touch. pairs well with a variety of denim skinnies...black, dark denim. planning to try with white ankle skinnies as well. the v-neck is just right. dips enough to show the neckline without revealing cleavage. it's the perfect lightweight layer for spring to fall. i even added a black blazer for a cool evening out. love this top and would buy in other colors.
Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did! it fits like a dream! this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried.
"I literally bought this dress 2 days ago and now it is listed as ""no longer available"" on the retailer site. i am a size 12 with about a 36b-c bust. the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra. i was really surprised at how well constructed it was."
Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather, which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels, booties or flats making it extremely versatile.
I just received this in the mail today! fabric and construction are beautiful and high quality. my only concern was that it ran short on me all around. i am 5'2, 100lbs, 32b, 24 waist, 33 hips. the dress was an appropriate length all around but ran very short in the arm holes, the back cut-out, and the waist. i felt like i was trying to wear a little-girl's dress (and i tend to be short waisted and long-legged as is). i may exchange it for a regular size because it is such a beautiful dress!
I wanted to like this romper, it is very cute and colorful, but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.
Bought peach online, but exchanged for other color. there is a metallic gold stripe that i didn't expect in peach option. i thought i would mention as it wasn't so apparent in photo. interestingly there is no metallic thread in the other color option.
The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing, you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.
It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3, 115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom, a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the pilcro hyphen chinos and stet chinos fit me perfectly, if a bit loose in the size 30. the size 30 in this flare pant was snug in the hips and waist and loose in the thighs and legs. i could not tuck a shirt in.

2. the front pockets with the leather trim are sewn shut. i'm fine with this, as it keeps the pockets aligned properly. however, there are still pockets on the inside incase you want to unpick all the stitching that's keeping the pocket clo"
"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters, but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot, but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli"
I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.
This dress is flattering and seems to be made well. the polka dots add interest. i am usually a 2 and did go up to a 4 in this. .
"I like the pointelle feature in the front. i end up wearing a lot of black, but this at least gives me the option to do a bit of color underneath if i so chose. i've worn this with white, black and blue jeans w/ boots. looks great. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. i got a medium, but i could have possibly gone with a small. my only complaint is that it might be a tad bit too long. since i'm on the shorter size, i can't imagine it would be too much of an issue for others."
"The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc, nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix.
it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base."
"Like other ladies have mentioned, this dress runs small in the chest and waist region. you must size up!
__________
pros:
- flattering fit and flow. hides lumps and bumps.
- cut at the neck and back is cute and didn't make me look chunky surprisingly.
- little red polka dots aren't overwhelmingly at all and add a nice retro feel.
- good overall length.
- usa made!
__________
cons:
- runs small in the chest and waist. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 170 lbs and normally can wear a size 10 in tops"
This fits so perfect! it is light fabric, not clingy. very flattering! i am 5'4 120lbs with athletic build.
This dress fits so perfectly.  just the right amount of skin, not too bare, not too short, not too long.  can't wait to wear it.  great quality.
This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure.
"I wasn't sure how this was going to look on me, but it was so darned cute, i had to give it a try. and i love it! i'm 5'4"" around 130lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try. the medium fit best. the length is perfect. hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same. the material is light but nothing see thru about it. it is slimming and looks so cute on! so glad i gave it a try."
This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!
"This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is"
I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.
My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!
This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.
"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3"".  neckline is fem"
Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.
"I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6"" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me."
This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely, i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!
Just a warning, the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal, so as soon as i saw that, the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures, to me, it cheapens the whole dress, which would otherwise be adorable.
I like this shirt and think its very feminine.
I am wearing a medium in the photos, my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.
This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...
"I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium
i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks.
it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works"
"Very soft and lovely t-shirt. beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck. i am 140 lbs and 5' 4"" and got a large."
"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".
it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
"I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6"" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well."
Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als
"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!"
I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.
"Will be cute in the summer months and with a pair of sweater tights will work for holiday parties. doesn't seem to come in a petite which is a bummer so i sized down.
."
Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!
Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!
"This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens, but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me, it all felt more cloying than clever.

the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i"
I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area.
"Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.

unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me.

but it is a beautiful dress"
Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.
"I tend to like grey, black simple clothes with a splash here and there for everyday. this will be perfect in the fall/winter. it is wool, so be prepared for the felted wool feel, but it is casual comfortable. i am 5' 4"" and boxy. the medium is still roomie on me but that is how i like it."
The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.
I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!
The jacket is cute, it runs small but looks good. i like it even though it feels tight on my arms.
These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.
"This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! 
it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed."
These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!
I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it
Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.
"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit"
"I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though, very soft, lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either, which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too, and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine, while not being overly ""precious"". it does run small by a whole size, which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a"
"I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't ""heavy"" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!"
This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.
I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online, but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo, still a type of ivory, but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking, but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit, but for the price and fabric, i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.
Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.
I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.
These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.
These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.
I love this sweater. it's warm, comfortable, and soft. nice quality too.
Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.
This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on, an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.
Love this romper! very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour, it's not sheer and undergarments won't show through. a forgiving fit for everyone
These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.
"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top."
I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!
"I was very excited to receive this dress. i ordered my normal size small, which i should have realized was a mistake. you could fit two of me in that size small. i realize the dress is supposed to be ""flowy"" but it would have been baggy on me at nine months pregnant. the fabric is soft and comfy and the pattern is cute, but order at least one size down. i'm going to exchange for the xs in hopes of it not resembling a short muumuu."
This dress has a great design for any frame. it looks great with a belt to accentuate the waist but the dress stands great alone and doesn't require a lot of styling.
Such a pretty little sweater, gorgeous detail. i wish it were a bit longer, it was too boxy for my large chest. otherwise it fits tts. i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap. so comfortable. please make more sweaters in this knit!
"And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.

colors are actually great, i don't know why people have issues ""matching"" - black or navy are equally neutral in my books...

"This dress is perfect for wearing in autumn (and beyond)! it will look great with casual flats or sneakers while it's still warm outside and it will be very stylish and cozy with a denim jacket and boots when it's cooler outside. it runs large in the skirted portion of the dress, like last season's similar floral dresses by this brand. the dress is a medium weight rayon and is not lined; some people might want to wear a slip or half slip or wear leggings with this dress for modesty. as for the c"
This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.
I love this dress! it's super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn't bind anywhere--yet somehow it's still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also, it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots, tights, a long-sleeved black t-shirt, etc.).
Well made & lined. great find for the fall!
"I am short (5'3'"") and have a short torso so the empire waist line was really flattering. i got the petite size small and it fell just above my knee. loose skirt portion led to an easy look to the dress. overall, super cute!"
This is such a unique design and i love the colors. i could be a small or x-small and chose the x-small, fits perfectly.
The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
Really cute, really comfy, great color, love the oversize buttons! all around just a great skirt. nice shade that goes right into fall. i have several of this style skirt and love them all!
Comfortable, stretchy fabric. i ordered the xs and will probably take the sides in at least a couple of inches for a snugger fit...the fit is looser than it looks on the model.
This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough, unflattering shape, too masculine, too boring, too wrinkly, or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter, but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple, plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me, year round. i have other cloth & stone tops, and have loved them all. their
Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!
"I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.

the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality."
This is a cute dress, but it runs very large through. if i had decided to keep it, i would have taken it to my seamstress to remove some of the volume. when i ordered, i assumed it was red and black checked, but it is navy. my black cropped leather jacket and boots won't work with those colors, so it is going back.
Really love this top even more than i expected based on the picture. i have already worn it 6 times in a short period of time. it's been a great fall top
This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy, comfortable, stylish, and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down, the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red, but i think you could wear black boots with it, no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!
I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change
This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,
"No, no, no...i don't know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging, or what, but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down. i'm 5'7"", about 145, 32c, usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. this thing barely buttoned over my bust, and then flares out to a tent-like triangular shape at the bottom. i don't think it would come out by washing and ironing it; i'm afraid it was just cut poorly. i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes, unfortunately. i bought three different dresses in the"
"I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped."
First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.
"I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. 

i'm a size 2 and bought a small."
This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it's definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.
I just got this top in the mail and love love love it! i thought it was on the pricey side for a shirt, but couldn't help but purchase it full price because i love anything pineapple print! the metallic print is cute and chic from day to night. i also love the open shoulders, making this design different and perfect for summer. i'm only sorry that i didn't see this top online until i already returned from my vacation in maui! very comfortable and easy, worth the price!
This skirt has a unique, fun pattern and a fit that is absolutely perfect. just figure flattering without being too tight or revealing. can't wait to wear it for a holiday dinner.
"I'm in love with this skirt! i already have so many outfits planned out! i do feel it runs slight large, maybe half a size?? i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and usually wear a 6. i ordered a small, and it's fairly loose, but i like that personally. if you want a tighter pencil look, then size down."
I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.
"I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i'm bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i'm 5'5"" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips, the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it."
"I ordered both colors and my usual size (in eptites) and one size smaller... definitely true to size as in not smaller size. 

i am 5'1.5"" and the best size was xs petite. 

i ordered both colors and msut say they are both gorgeous, so can't go wrng there, as long as it goes with your skin tone, for me the red was better, but i did love hte neutral color as well.

comes with a lining #bude color#.
wasit is elasticized, and comfortable, love the sleeves, this is light enough for spring and"
Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute, work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.
"I debated for awhile about getting this dress. being tall i was worried that it would be really short on me, so i ended up ordering it in a large (i'm 5'10"" a size 10/12.) it definitely has a blousey look to it which i like. i kind of wish i had ordered it in a medium as well, but i think the large will work just fine. the length is good (hits right above my knee), the elastic waistband is nice because i can pull it up around my natural waist or pull it down for more of a drop waist effect. as o"
I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit, they run really small, i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras, so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras, the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck, or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt, the top of the cup shows. bummer!
I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful, breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline, upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
"Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops.
i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans."
If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans, then you'll love this one! the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that you'll wonder if you should've bought a smaller size. it's also a great length for fall/winter and looks fabulous with boots. i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back!
It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.
"The dress has a partially sewn-in slip, which really didn't work for me. no matter how much adjusting i did i couldn't get the slip and dress to sit properly.

i ordered a medium, and if it hadn't been for the slip, the fit would have been good. the length was as pictured. for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40, 34ddd."
Easy to wear dress that looks polished and professional for work.
"I wanted to love this dress as it seemed perfect for spring and summer, but it just didn't work for me. it made me feel a bit frumpy, honestly. i purchased the neutral color. maybe the ""red"" would have been less... grandmotherly. something about the elastic waist just didn't work for me either. i tried this with boots, booties, heels, clogs, flats, sandals and i just couldn't make this dress work. sadly sending this one back. i'm 5'7"", 140 lbs and tried the medium."
Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!
I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
"The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5""- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf"
Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(
I love the cold shoulder trend, and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue, which is really more like a very light mint green. however, i think the material is pretty thin (though soft), and the keyhole sleeve area, right by the twist, is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small, but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds, 32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price, thou
I like the idea of this but had to return it. the fitted liner is attached at shoulders and awkward to get into. the shirt is too poofy. didn't flatter short and curvy.
"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband"
I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress
"Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9""). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls"
I must be one of the rare people that this dress did not work for.  i adored it online and even on the hanger.  putting it on, it just looked frumpy on me (i tried my usual small first).  decided i must need a smaller size, so i sized down to an xs.  this one looked much better on, but was nearly impossible to get in and out of, the built in slip got twisted and i had to start over twice).  i decided i wasn't willing to work up a sweat getting dressed and undressed when i wore it.  i passed.
I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then, i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd, i can't even explain it.
Great dress that can be casual or dressy. well-made and comes with.a built-in slip.
"The linen makes it a big wrinkly mess. i tried it on and just the act of trying it on, made it so wrinkly. i would have bought it in a second had it not been for that. love the mango color..i am in-between a 2-4 and went with the 2. i'm 5'3 and the length was a few inches above my knee...there is also a separate slip attached.
bummer.. maybe this won't bug some people but it would drive me mad. :-)"
I just received this dress and it so adorable with the pineapple print, really flattering on and very well made. the shoulder styling and cut out in the back makes it really stand out for style. the con for this cute styling is it is not bra friendly no matter what bra you wear. even strapless will show in the back cut out as it is open where most bras go. it has handy side pockets and fits very true to size. i'm a 12 in most dresses and the 12 fit perfectly everywhere. but, i am sending it back
Perfect for day at the beach! i'm 5'6 and the length is just right above knee not too short. fresh and cool cotton. comfortable feel.
"Absolutely gorgeous!
words can't describe the beauty of this dress!
i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs)."
Really cute dress -- the lace-up detail is distinctive, and i think this dress will be versatile. great for hot weather, but i tried it on with retailer skinny pants, and that looked cool too. the included slip (not a lining) is soft and not clingy. i'm on the petite size and often find that relaxed-fit dresses like this make me look like i'm wearing a sack, but this one is not too billowy or shapeless. i tried the mango color on in the store, and really wanted to buy it, but the color just is not
"This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7"" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh"
"I found this to be a comfortable, stylish, no-fuss look. bought my normal size 4 (5'7"", 128#) in the orange, and it fits like the model. it's a nice lightweight linen and is machine washable, which is always a plus. you can't tell from the photo, but the lace-up portion actually has a bit of fabric in it, so you aren't revealed if it isn't tightly laced ;)"
I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
"I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however, the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus, it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it."
I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
Pretty top. quality material, it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy, if you don't size down, the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
This top was really cute on someone else, but not on me... on me, ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too, just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season, it is a bit boxy, but looks nice with jeans, white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...
"When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5""). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!"
I am normally a size m, sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs, but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(
I ordered this dress in 0p since i am 5ft. it fits great its not too short just above the knee.
I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.
I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!
The fabric is very soft, love the purple floral color. the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a t-shirt.
"When this appeared on line, i thought t would be a sure thing, color (blue), cut and style, this dress appeared to have been made for me, but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5"" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a"
"Great dress for a full figure.
forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests, athletic vests, sweaters, jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots, dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi"
This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.
I ordered the black and white pattern, which was ok. i got a small, but the shirt was very square - with a short and wide fit! i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt. sent this one back.
"Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy."
Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.
"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi"
I was looking forward to receiving this dress. i am tired of all of the swing dresses - most of which are not flattering on my petite frame. i am also uncomfortable with dresses that fall much above the knee as i am somewhat older. the colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful. vibrant, but not too bright. when i got it on i was thrilled with the fit - until i looked at the back. there are pleats at the waist in back and there is way too much fabric. it looked like i had a bustle under the d
Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.
This top is soft, comfortable and drapes nicely. the print makes it fresh and different. i sized down to a small.
Perfect fit shirt. super cute and very comfortable. i purchased a size xl at first but it was too large, l fit perfect. i'm normally a size 14 on top, but this runs large.
The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40.
"I am short (5'3"") and very curvy. i usually get petite in dresses. something about this fit was strange. it was definitely a little shorter than most petites. the lace detail on the front of this dress is really cute and it is a color you don't see often so i kept it."
"This top is gorgeous in person, but when i tried it on, i fell out of love. it didn't happen immediately, but the more i wore it around the fitting room area, the less i appreciated its beauty. i tried it on in an xs - i typically wear a s or xs in most retailer tops - 5'8"", 140 lbs for reference. this top is just huge in the body! the fit is very boxy and just not flattering. yes, it could be cute with skinny jeans and perfect for preggo's! this was just a miss for me."
A great white blouse! i expected this top to be sheer and yet it's quite opaque. i bought the white in a size small, i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering. relaxed yet super polished look.
I bought the white tee. while the print is nice, the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.
This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons
This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.
Loved this dress until i tried it on! it was too big in the body and tight on top in the arm area. from the reviews already posted stating the guy was great, i'm wondering if i just received a defective dress? i also wish the dress were a truer orange/mango color instead of a burnt orange since this dress is for spring/summer.
I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the
I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.
This is why i shop at retailer. i was in one of my local stores recently, mainly to check out the sale. my boyfriend was with me. we hadn't been in the store 5 minutes when we passed a table with piles of folded tees. this one caught my eye. the color, omg! and then flowers and butterflies! try it on, he said, as i held one up. no..... i shouldn't. we wandered around, checked out the sale and all the new. and i was back at that table looking at that tee. so, i took a small and an xs to the fitting
I love the way the dress fit definitely a flip flop by the poolside bar dress. i ordered the mango colored one and was disappointed that the color resembled a dark squash orange and not as bright as it looked in picture. i think it will look nice with a tan so i will keep it. wouldn't plan to dress it up too much because it will definitely wrinkle ! i am a petite 5'4 and got the regular and it fits just above my knees which is good for my taste!
"Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!
will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.
the slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slip.
i wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend. 
looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!"
I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!
Have had many compliments on this tee! feels dressed up without feeling too fancy
I have the purple and the white. i purchased the purple first in m. it wasn't too big to return, but it was a little roomier than necessary but when i saw the white on sale, i purchased it in s which fit just fine--still plenty roomy as the style allows. both these are cute alone and also with a little sweater or denim jacket. i haven't washed them yet but i imagine washing on delicate with a good gentle detergent will keep them looking nice for a long time.
"I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it. it's so flattering and well constructed, if a little longer than i usually prefer. i'll just have to wear pumps with it. i don't have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress. it does have pockets, also. i ordered the 12 and it fits beautifully. for reference i have a 40"" bust and 33"" waist."
I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.
I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!
This was just what i wanted. a simple design (so many of retailer's suits have way too much going on) and this one fit the bill. sexy, strappy and clean. i can't wait to live in this top this summer.
So happy to say this dress was built for my body type.  i'm heavier & wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodice/halter fits perfectly and comfortably.  going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft a-line, the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty.  yes, the fabric is heavier weight, so i wouldn't recommend wearing in hot & humid weather.  i love the unique print & colors!  i do not own anything in this color combination.  the retro vibe is strong in this one so i
I got the red, which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute, but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return, but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)
I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!
The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.
This top runs very large and is loose fitting in the middle. it looks very flattering and is very comfortable. i bought the one in red and it looks quite good. i would go down one size, maybe two.
I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.
This shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent. this shirt runs ridiculously large. purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl. no impressed with the pattern in person. looks cheap. will be returning.
Beautiful dress appears well-made, but unfortunately i wasn't able to get it on! about 6 inch gap in the zipper over chest area. first time i've ever sent something back to retailer for not fitting.
I purchased the mango. it is flattering with my olive skin and golden brown hair. i am keeping it. i'm used to linen so no surprises there. i agree with a reviewer that said it will work in summer and fall. i could wear this walking on the beach, to a summer casual dinner party. i plan on wearing gold sandals and gold jewelry. this will make the feel more summertime. then i will wear boots with it in the fall. i'm very happy with the choice. my store didn't have the blue. the fit is tts. i'm 5 f
Really pretty blue top. great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door, of if you have to run a quick errand! if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe. the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color. don't get me wrong. the top is casual and cute. it is not sloppy and has an international, worldly vibe. i recommend it.
I bought the dress in mango. i love the color. it is very vibrant. the fit is great and i imagine getting a lot of use out of this dress during the summer months. my only complaint is that i expected the fabric to be a little bit heavier. i find it to be kind of thin.
I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!
I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it.  it is stunning in person.
"The smallest size, xs, was big on me, i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape, doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though, but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green, made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.

for reference xs bog on 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,

i got compliments on all the looks. i think it's a fun and cheerful, feminine summer top.

i got mine on sale so i thought was a fair price for what it is. wouldn't have paid full retail.

requires ironing.

i am a size 4 and 5'3 and have a small."
This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.
I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin
Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me
"The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.
will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it."
Extreme comfort for travel and out door activities.
I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!
...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print, colors, and design. however, i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it, the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.
"I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap"
"This is a pretty adorable jumper. the size 8 would fit someone really well who's about a typical size 6 and maybe 5'6"". i'm 5'9"" and it was too short. it's fun and definitely different. i'd otherwise wear it."
A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!
Great alternative to yoga pants, these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!
I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly, it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable, but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine, but it is a thin sweater.
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!
"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these, but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin, tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short. 

i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on, which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them, i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.

"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return."
"Subtly chic raincoat, with a lovely drape (except see below) and wonderful details like the large diagonal-opening pockets, snaps, and decorative cord. the striped lining throughout is a cozy but light jersey layer. the coat would be ample cover for temps in the high fifties or low sixties.

problems: the double zipper was hard to use, but in my experience with other jackets, you get the hang of a wonky zipper eventually.

there seemed to be a problem with a seam by the left pocket so that m"
This jumper is adorable and very well made! it is a bit tight in the ankles and it kind of gives me a hungry bum look but then i realized i ordered a 4p so it is actually tts. going to preview this number at my bachelorette party!
"This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn't wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5'5"" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too 'long and heavy' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn't work for my body type, making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are, made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a"
This is a lovely dress, with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however, it runs small in the waist, if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
"I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute, but serious size issues, i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6"" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!"
Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin, which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.
I so wanted to keep this, but the xs was even too big. i usually take an xs/s petite and thought i could get away with the xs of this. it is just too big. so sad to be returning it, wish it came in an xxs or petite.
I sized up to my higher size choice and it was snug. not for athletic builds. top was fitted and thighs tight which caused the belly area to pouf out. good for very thin gals. also good if you are long waisted.
The previous review was right: this jacket/coat feels and looks expensive. nice weight, very soft. pattern is better in person. i normally always wear a l and in this, i can't decide between the s or m.
I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up, it runs too small.
Great idea, but this was not a flattering top on me. it almost worked, but ended up making me look like i am pregnant?not a look i am striving to achieve?it has potential and maybe others with a different body type may have success. ( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price, it did not justify a place in my closet?
"These jeans are amazing. they are so comfortable.  they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day. i am 5'4"" and 135 lbs and purchased  my usual size 27. i did have to have them shortened 
but only b/c i bought in store and did not have the petite online option. i have worn them on several occasions. great purchase."
I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.
"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them."
These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.
I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.
"Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4"" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!"
I love these bottoms they are super cute, comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. 

i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats."
"I have a hard time with skinny pants due to my muscular thighs... but these worked. the length on the petite was a tad long, but i see on the model hers do a similar thing so perhaps it is meant to be that way... would look better with heels for me (below 5'2"")"
"I love it but i don't at the same time:

sheer, so sheer, you can probably get away with a nude bra, but not sure... i tried on both colors, and love them both. love the shimmer... i ordered btoh xxs p and xxs regular...i think i would go with regular, the petite seemed cropped on me, so if i lift my arms, hello belly...

so overall, i would probably get this if it goes on sale, color is either way, but since i don't have an immediate need, i passed. nice turtleneck, though.

reference: 11"
"I have been waiting for these to go on sale for some time now, and so happy to day they still had my size...in both colors. i don't usually buy 2 things the same in different colors, but in this case, i did...

fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5"", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit"
"I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair.

feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!"
Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!
This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6
Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.
"When i first received this sweater, i was a little worried about the bulk, especially the thick cables and popcorn stitches. after i got it on and adjusted it to all the right places, i would say it looks similar to the model in the photo. i did not find it itchy. the yarn is soft and airy but i guess it depends on how sensitive your skin is. the length was low hip on me and i'm 5'9"" tall. overall, i'm very pleased and looking forward to wearing it. can't speak to the quality of the garment beca"
I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.
The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but, the fabric looks like old, matted carpet. i will be returning.
This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.
I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
"I like design of the dress, softness and color ( i got grey), the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5'6"" 145 lbs) i got m fits ok but i don't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time. despite i got it with 40% discount it will come back as it's poor quality."
This dress is by no means a statement piece, but if you're in need of a good basic to get you through winter, this is a great option. i'm normally a m or l (busty and hippy hourglass shape) and found it to fit tts in a l. (if you fall in-between two sizes but don't have larger hips or a larger bust like i do, you could probably size down to the smaller of your two sizes.) it goes great with black tights, tall black boots and a scarf. i didn't realize at the time i ordered it that the material is
I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.
I'm in love with this top! looks just like it does in the photos, except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant. it's definitely boxy, so you may not like it if boxy isn't your thing, but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape. i usually wear a small in tops and the xs/s fits great. it's also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus (although i haven't washed it yet). unique, chic, and effortless...order before it's gone!
So sad that this cardigan did not fit me. i listened to the review i read and tried a small, didn't come close to fitting. i tried a medium and it also did not fit. i think this item is designed for someone who has a small frame. i seem to be too tall for the item and too big in the chest. i usually always fit into a size medium.that being said the cardigan is very pretty and feminine, has an interesting design and is well made. so sad this item didn't work for me :-(
I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.
Cute style, cute color, cute cut.  and i got it on sale!
I wanted so badly to keep this dress :( the print is beautiful in person, and the fabric feels pretty nice for a polyester. the waist silhouette is incredibly flattering--the way the waistline and pleats fall made me a look a lot slimmer. it'd be a great dress for dancing, since it flares wonderfully when you twirl. but the puffed sleeves looked a lot more poofy on me than they did on the model, and i wound up looking exactly like a picture of my mother from 1982. which isn't necessarily a bad t
"Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them"
"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms, and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8"", 128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially, women quite far along in their pregnancy."
I really wanted to like this dress on me, but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites, but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly, i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
"My friend and i both bought this in the ""white"" color in our usual sizes. the fabric is soft, the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute. hides a tummy beautifully. the store had the white and the green. the green color looks very different in person than it does online. in person, it is darker and more of a soft emerald green--not the pale green-gray pictured online."
"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"", medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal"
I was very excited when i saw this in a perk email and immediately went to order it. unfortunately, the stock image of this pullover is misleading. it's boxy (image makes it seem like it's form-fitting) and the weave/mesh is much thicker and open in person. as shown, you do need a cami underneath. i ordered this in a small and medium since it's an online exclusive and there were no other products by on the road to see reviews of to know how their tops fit. i wanted to love this. i didn't think i
"I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown, which it was, but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little"
"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs, for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute, just a little loose through the body."
"First, this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look. 
however, there are several items to note. primarily, this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves."
I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.
I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.
So this is actually a holding horses dress, its mislabeled on the website. tts, a stunning vintage inspired piece, very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut, this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small, fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!
"Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice, but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.

the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th"
"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim, and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also, it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway, i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning."
"This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green, not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband, which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy, elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks, i decided to remove the tie string, which hangs low; it"
I didn't think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website. but after reading the reviews i decided to order it. and it did not disappoint. i ordered the green, which is more vibrant in-person than on the website. and i wore it the next day, which is always a good sign. i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too. it is flattering, stylish and comfortable - an excellent combination! i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple. it goes with everything.
"Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color. great tank. it is not thin like some other retailer tops. it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we don't want anyone to see or worry about. 
the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.
it is extremely comfortable a"
I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.
This dress' style and color is very flattering. i think i will wear it in the spring and fall as well as the winter.the m fits me and i'm 5'8' and 140 pounds.
I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.
I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.
"Love these, always get compliments. i'm 5'7"" bought size small. washed in warm & line dried. they are a bit shorter. lengthen the straps, drops the waist, but at least gets them to my feet"
"This top is flowy, fluid and comfortable. the material is like a stretchy crepe. it's thin, but not sheer. well, i bought the bright red (maybe white is sheer?). oh, speaking of bright red, well it is! i mean, it is the most vibrant red. the photo on-line (at least on my screen) doesn't really do the red justice at all.

the fit is true to size. the nice thing about this top is that it has movement and yet it isn't full of fabric and look like a maternity top. and, the armholes are not big. th"
Gorgeous sweater, very unique, given as a gift so not sure how well it will wear
"I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review, it runs large in the armholes and across the bust, which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit, so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however, i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said, the detailing i"
"I wanted to roder hte petite version, as it runs long, but they are out of the ivory. i put hte green-ish color in my basket, and may order it, but for now, i am hlding off as i have other nice seaters... so many choices.

long, warm, fun closure, falttering, and nice tie back detail."
Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for
"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide, but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color, which is more green and has very faint stripes. very"
I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.
Great fit, a little stiff. i typically wear a 4, and was able to take a 2 in this skirt, though a 4 would probably have been fine! it's just a fun skirt, with a little shimmer to dress up an outfit.
"This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion. it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo. i'm 5'6"". i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable. i would suggest 1 size smaller than usual would fit well. i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses. it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan. it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus 1 turquoise stripe. it dresse"
This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.
Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however, that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically, for the price, i was underwhelmed and will return it.
I bought the gray and it is so much prettier than it appears online. i agree with a previous post that it feels lighter but that works for me because i find wool terribly itchy and this sweater is not. i love it!
"I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture."
Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.
"I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6"" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back"
Love this dress! it's so soft & not to short like some retailer dresses. great transition piece! i'm a fan of bell sleeves & can't wait to wear this with boots& tights this fall.
The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.
I usually wear a small, sometimes and extra small, so when i ordered this skirt in a small, i wasn't worried. when it arrived, there is no stretch whatsoever and i'd have to wear it really it high in order to zip it. not necessarily a bad look but it is a little uncomfortable (no give, stiff material). it is really pretty, bright color and the eyelets and slit are unique. might try the next size up.
Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.
The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back. it is absolutely beautiful!! the sweater is lightweight, perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day.. i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on sale.(unless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will.) i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater. the small was bit tight
"I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing!
super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates, yoga, playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls."
I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.
"I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8"" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)"
"I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however, the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out."
I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.
"This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted, and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties."
I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.
This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al
"The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very ""blah,"" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.

generally, it was interesting but not a ""most come home wit"
I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch, the fabric is very nice, i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.
"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t"
"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit, long and not clingy at all. i love the 80's motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.
the black design was strange - hearts, fox, cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well, but the black ""green"" design was too off."
Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!
My new go to skirt. great color for transitioning from summer to fall. i love the pockets and detailing, and yes, oh so soft...
"I can't get over how fabulous this looks on, how well it fits, and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8"" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding, evening out, or the office."
"I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both, but sadly, the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all, a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces, but they were different angles, which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b"
I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think it's such a nice deal. i really like how this one is soft, well made, has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is. the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit. i didn't find this one too boxy for me as it's a topper after all. there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think it's a great piece to throw on w
Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!
I've seriously been on the hunt for a olive green military-ish style skirt for a couple years now and i think i've found it! the color is great! the finishings are cool(rose gold buttons!) i actually like the a-line, it give me room to sit down without riding up. the waist is pretty fitted, verging on tight and i ordered an 8. i'm usually a 6 or 8 in bottoms, but i need to trim off a few pounds from a recent vaca! so i'm keeping the 8, it will probably be perfect soon enough! the length is just
"I'm 5'2"", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return."
"Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom, but this was too cute to pass up. fits great, extremely flattering to my athletic build, super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3"" and did not have to hem it."
I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it
This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.
"If you are afraid of the jumpsuit trend but like dresses, this will be for you. 
 the cut is flattering, and may not need a bra (i am droppy, but it was fine). the legs are wide enough that one time, i had both legs in one hole, so-to-speak, and it is very flowy. the patterns are both nice, i like the geometric one, but the polka dot is always a classic. the petite size fit me just right (xsp) at 115 lbs, 30dd. i like the tie it goes from around the cups to tie on the back, so you can almost ti"
"I ordered the 25 (my usual is 25p lately, maybe vanity sizing, used ot be 26p), anyway, could not pull all the wayup or tie...

otherwise, good cut and nice coloring. if you have non0muscular legs and bottoms, thee would be great. going back (i am 115lbs)"
"I loved this at first sight, and ordered it in a 10, 12, and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra, so usually braless is not an option, but this actually offers enough support. and, if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it. 

it's super flattering, and really fun to wear out day or night."
Love these pants, and will wear them all season like a uniform. but, the quality is a little low. made in china, and the black dye may be coming off on white clothes and my skin. i haven't washed them yet, and a little scared to. super comfy, stretchy and still classy despite the quality issues.
I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it's washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i've gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn't shed/pilled either. well-made, quirky and useful for layering!
The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!
I met my friend at the mall today.  she complimented me on my outfit (i was wearing this jumpsuit in the navy with white polka dots motif - there's also a red, black, and white geometric print if you're not into polka dots).  half way through our time together, she realized that i was wearing a jumpsuit, not a dress.  she said that the legs are so wide and flowy that she couldn't tell.  we tried on clothes at another store and i forgot to re secure the straps with the little snaps to my bra stra
"I bought these assuming they would be the same as a pair of pilcro stet ankle jeans i bought a couple of years ago. this pair has less stretch than my older ones, so they are a bit tighter. i'm 5'2"" and these are more like a perfect length regular jean (rather than ankle). i always have trouble finding jeans that fit my curves, but smaller waist. these are a bit big in the waist, with the butt and legs fitted. all-in-all they are a nice looking durable denim that flatters."
This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.
I really like the color of this and the feel, but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with, and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it, but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice, loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami, looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.
Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.
I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer, unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this, and in my mind, that defeats the purpose of a lightweight, sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.
"5'1'' 43-31-43
i bought a petite medium in the orange red color and it's a wonderful cardigan with an oversize fit. it goes to about an inch below my knees, and the slits go up to mid-thigh. the sleeves start at about an inch past the shoulder cap, but the sleeves are so generous that you still have full range of motion. the sleeves hit mid hand and i wish they were an inch or two longer, but that's personal preference. because of the color and the long side-slits looks really stunning with a mi"
Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!
I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.
I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously, how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear, but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft, comfy fabric. i
I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting it...definitely a super weird cut. extreme a-frame. the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise. i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure. i am going to keep anyway. i've already worn it with jeans and a t-shirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress. it actually looked fantastic with both. i'll get a lot of wear out of it, just not the way
I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.
This dress is super cute. good quality. from the front it is very flattering and hangs well. from the side and back it looks huge. i ordered a size 4 and i am a normal 6 or 8. i have re-ordered the 0 and size 2 to see if there is less material (others have mentioned that the arms are smaller in the smaller size. my trouble area is my hips so i don't think this will be an issue as i am quite small on top). if not i will have it altered because it is so cute and can be worn many different ways.
I bought this dress in store today in a size 4, i usually wear an 8 (so i was thrilled) the print and details are gorgeous but it's a very wide swing dress, there is a lot of fabric and it has no waist. i'm going to wear this with a belt so it's fine but the images online are a little misleading.
This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles. from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights, to donning a bolo and ankle boots, heads will turn when you walk into the room.
I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.
Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they, firstly, aren't eloise like i assumed they would be, and secondly, that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure, but i'm
"I'm a 36ddd, and have a bust about 42"" so when i tried this on in a size 12, i honestly didn't expect to be able to squeeze it on... and yet i had inches upon inches to spare in the bust. this really is built more like a tent than a dress. on the bright side though, if you belt it, and gather the extra material at the sides it'll define your waist and the skirt has lots of swing and flounce to it. i do love a line styles!! 

i found i had to roll up the sleeves otherwise the dress looked too s"
Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!
"Was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it's adorable! it does run large. i am 5'6"", 125lb and the 2 fits perfectly. it is super comfortable. i am taking away a star only because it doesn't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out?"
"I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss. this one's a definite hit:) i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap (unique, bohemian, feminine, cozy), the fabric (beautiful intricate weave, high quality knit, wearable virtually year-round thanks to air conditioning), how stylish it is (fringe, very ""in"" kimono cocoon cardigan), how much of my wardrobe it goes with (neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down, elegant or casual), and the fact that it has"
"Great dress in terms of material, quality, print...something about the weight with the lining made it not work for me. i ordered one size down as recommended by other reviewers, but that didn't work; there was too much fabric for the length and the lining made it look heavier. i ordered a medium and i""m 5'5"" on the curvy side. oh well. i've had so much luck with other retailer orders so i'm not too disappointed."
I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it. i love the tassel on the back at the tie. the fabric is not too sheer. the fit is loose and will be cool this summer.
"I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!
 like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8"" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down."
Love this top!!!! it is just gorgeous and fits great!
"Larger than life in both size and personality. this one runs pretty big however the detailing in the fabric itself and embroidered collar balance that out. it's even more gorgeous in person! 
for reference, i'm 5'7"", 125lb, straight up and down and i usually go for a 4 or 6 / small. i got a 4, but could have easily fit into the 2 or even the 0."
"These are very cool leggings. the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging. they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit. i wore them for the first time today and really loved them. i didn't feel like i was out in ""leggings"" but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants. the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over - including the rear. they are definitely sculpting and firming. they fit the same size-wise as"
I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8, got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.
"Based on others' reviews, i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size. as others mentioned, it runs 1-2 sizes large. but, unlike others, i don't feel i need a belt at the waist. i am 5'2"" 140# 34d and with my body style (super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty) this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape!!!  and the design and quality are superb to boot!!!"
As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.
I agree with the other reviews - great dress. i got a ton of compliments on it, but i had to take it to a tailor to get it taken in. not a fan of belts with dresses, but definitely wanted it so had quite a bit taken in. not sure why this seems to be a reoccurring issue with retailer. i was bummed i had to spend money to get the dress to look even somewhat like the photo.
Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b
I liked this blouse very much the minute i first seen it, it looks exactly as pictured but sits much better in person. i'm 6ft tall 160lb ordered a 10 which was true to size with a little more room to the bottom. i was able to see my belly button through the sheer part of the bottom fabric, but as soon as i sucked my belly in, it was fine. the quality of the fabric is so-so i had some threads hanging out here and there, but this top looks very good in person and the design is unique, you can hav
"I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference, i am 5'7"" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way, but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise, it's a great, casual piece. the material is light and soft, and it's cute over leggings."
"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is"
"This shirt is amazing. it's soft, comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.

this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture, color, and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.

Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!
Love these bottoms, cheekier than i thought but like them even more!
Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!
I ordered this sweater online in a size 12. i am 5'7 170 i normally wear a 10/12, i was swimming in this one. i could have ordered an 8 and been fine. the fabric feels luxurious but the twist in the shoulder is not sewn into place, you will have to steam/press it each time you wear it or you could have it sewed into place.
Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow, waaay too small.
I found this at my local retailer. it is a beautiful unique sweater. it fits nicely a bit longer in the back and a tad loose on the bottom. i've gotten loads of compliments as it's truly special. i'm not sure why it's not sold out yet!
"Purchased this top in medium. i am 5'9"" so normally wear medium. however, could probably have ordered a small. sleeves are very long and it's very full around bottom. love the gold color!"
The length of these pants is not quite long enough. i'm 5'8, and the only way i can make these work is if they're pulled low on the hips. it'd be nice if more brands offered long and short sizes in lounge
This cut and fit is so good. i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally, and i was glad i did. it fits just right!
This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w
"Pros--this dress is so super soft and warm...i feel like i'm just wearing a winter throw when i have it on.

cons--way, way too big. i returned the small, which easily should have been a large (with room to spare) and got the extra small...it's still way too big. they definitely have this dress clipped behind her back so it doesn't look so huge and there's a reason there isn't a video showing how this dress looks when it moves...because it is ginormous and they know it!

but i still kept the xs"
"Like the other reviewers, i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute, though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway)."
"I couldn't believe how fast this dress sold out when they were having the fall promotion; they had just put it on the website and it sold out in my size in a matter of hours!  i just received the dress today and really like the practicality of it.  you can easily dress it up or down and it still looks sheek either way.  what i didn't like about the dress was that the material is a little flimsy compared to how it looks in the picture.  i am on the fence regarding if i will keep it."
This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer! it's very comfortable and fashionable.
I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!
"I was looking for an undergarment and this is more of a nightgown.
if it came in a solid color then i'd probably buy it.
i usually wear a small and this was a tad too tight.
on the upside, the fabric was soft and lightweight."
I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.
Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back.
"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase."
Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
"This coat is gorgeous. the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type!
when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way.
the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering.
i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful.
a must for retailer shoppers. 
i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection."
Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.
I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.
I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.
I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.
I agree with other reviewer, the material of these jeans is not the same! thin, stretches, and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short, curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big, so between true to size and big. it is both flattering and stretchy. the waist comes in nicely, the sleeves are not annoying, and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion. length was right above the knee.just. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist for reference...
"I received this jacket in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size so i ordered the s & m. i opened the medium first and found that to fit me well. i never tried the small on. fyi, i am 5'5"", 125 lbs. & 34a in the chest. it allowed some ""give"" room for layering, like the picture of the model. this is a very cute jacket, no doubt about it. i like the combo of the linen with the leather. the outside of the jacket is well constructed. the reason i put 4 stars and said ""but"" is because of the unfini"
"I am 5'8"" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)"
"For reference, i'm 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example, it's linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area,"
"I'm 5' 2"" and 110 lbs. i ordered this in xsp but it was a lot shorter in the front than led to believe from the photo. it was also a little baggy on top. otherwise, i love the material, shimmer and overall look. i will be exchanging this for a regular xxs."
Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.
I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat
This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.
"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy."
I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here, but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.
I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.
"This shirt arrived today, and i was surprised how short it is. not a tunic at all. i wonder if the lengths on these vary, and if i order it again, it would be a different length. i ordered my normal size, xs petite. i'm 5-2"", so this should have been a tunic on me. perhaps if i see this shirt in the store, i'll try on the regular length. i'm returning the petite!"
I wish these fit more like joggers, but they are slightly poofier. with the big buttons, i felt a bit too clownish. however, it's a great statement piece if you're up for it. the quality is good and the fabric has a nice texture. i think the problem was that since linen doesn't drape and scrunch like less structured fabrics, so it holds more volume instead of loose, semi-flowy menswear look. i
This dress is great! it's perfect for a casual look with a denim jacket, comfortable for traveling, and can even be dressed up for a more formal occasion. i wore it on a cross country flight (toronto-british columbia) and was so comfortable with a sweater and scarf to wrap around me if i got cold. the only con i found of this dress is the back is a bit low leaving your bra showing and being a 32-d i don't feel comfortable going without a bra. i purchased a few of the bralettes to go with it to m
"This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10"" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium"
"It's cute. it works with jeans, linen pants, flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a ""must have"". but i'm keeping it because it works!"
The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up, but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine), but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely, unique beach dress, this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!
I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.
"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's."
This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!
"I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2"", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th"
"It runs long for a 5'1"" woman like me:) other than that beautiful dress for vacation"
I usually wear xl in tops at retailer, but i picked this one up in a l. it's stretchy and super soft, but doesn't breathe all that well.
"I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back."
This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.
Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.
Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!
This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.
"As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me, i tried it in a small, medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2"", 145lbs, 36d. the dress is really pretty in person, but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9"", 100lbs, 34a, also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline, however the neckline is not open like in the picture, it's more pushed toget"
This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy, cool weather!! the white one goes with everything, and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy, quality mater
This is such a comfy top, and the fabric is really great. more supple / flowy than i expected. it does run larger than i expected. i typically wear a large, and it's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer. i would love to try a medium to see the difference, but since it was purchased online, i'm just going with it. this will get lots of wear this season.
Although i bought 2 sizes down from my regular size, they were still big and, made my derriere look flat. i would have kept them as weekend kick-around jeans, but the flat behind just made them a must return.
I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!
Got this in the gold and it's so much better than i imagined. runs longer on my 5'4 frame than on model but i love this extra long look with white fitted pants and heels. total classic easy elegance and comfortable too.
I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!
"Love the petroleum blue
unique twist design
love the sleeve length
perfect for work -- neckline not too low
great by itself or with a bib necklace and black jacket
absolute winner"
"As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th"
Great sweater, perfect weight for the office in the summer. love the delicate knit front and triple tie in the back. it was bigger and baggies than i was expecting, but it still works.
Lovely sweater! it's a new staple in my wardrobe. love the fit and styling, but what drew me in at first sight were the colors. it's warm and cuddly.
I got the top in green, it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.
I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest, it was shorter than i usually like my tops, so i will be returning it.
This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!
I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it
This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
This is very cute but runs small. my typical xs is too small all over. arms are short and top is short and tight. i'll order a small and hope it fits.
I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)
Love this blouse, however upon every time i wear it, a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!
The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.
Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.
This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!
I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! it's super soft and comfortable, and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs, and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!
"The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drape

the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh."
I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back, because i'm short, but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable, casual, girly, and well made. i'm happy with it.
A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.
"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

This top when pulled out of the box didn't look like much, the contrast of the buttons, wrinkly, shapeless... but, when i shook it out, tried it on i fell in love. it's so simple and versatile. prob the best white shirt i purchased this year, i'd say it pretty flowly, but that's the style and i love it. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i would purchase again, and in other colors if they had them.
This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides, but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.
I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!"
I bought a medium, my usual size, and had to exchange for a small. i love flowy sweaters, but this one truly fits one size big. the arms and body of the sweater fit larger. beautiful sweater with jeans or legging- can't wait to wear!
Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.
This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.
I love belted sweaters, but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.
I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.
"I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!

the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. 

the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're"
I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore
I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully, a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin
The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
This sweater looks exactly as represented in the picture. the detail on the cuffs, neckline and hemline make it unique and set it apart from the typical patterned sweater. i've worn it twice already and i'm very pleased.
I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o
"I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer, my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender, but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...

firstly, the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr"
This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app
Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!
"A sales associate suggested this top and i'm glad she did. it's easy to miss at first!
-------------------
pros:
- beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.
- double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.
- lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.
- roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.
- great fabric. forgiving fit.
- can be dressed up or down.

Based on other reviews i was hesitant to order, but i loved the colors and design in the blouse. it was on major sale so i took a chance and could not be more pleased. it is very sheer as other reviewers have noted so i was expecting that. i wear a cami under nearly everything so no problem for me. the colors are tdf and i can wear well into fall down here in south ms. there were a few strands of thread hanging from various seams but i gently clipped with scissors. if you are attracted to the to
This shirt is so comfortable and flattering. the quality is really good but i would definitely size down. it's not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeans/jeggings..
"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd"
This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it, and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy, it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases, and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.
The color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized. if you want to layer it, then it might be for you, but i was hoping for more of a tailored look.
The print on this top is even more gorgeous in person. the fit was great, and the removable halter strap is always a plus. this swim top, however, doesn't have padding, and the material is slightly thin, so this could cause an issue for some. overall, however, it looked great. for reference, i am an a cup, and purchase the small.
"This anorak is perfection! perfect weight, color, and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5""3, 130lbs, 32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!"
I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
This is a subtle, classy shirt. i'm 5'7, 122 lbs and an xs fit perfectly. shirts like these, that don't fit snugly on my back cover my poor posture (genetic) and make me look like i am standing up straight. nice!
I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty, perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty, but the fit is selective, so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.
This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire), which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge, as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras, but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!
I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is, i'm usually a 2 or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference, i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in, i'd recommend you go up a size as well!
I recently purchased this dress and i am very happy with the quality. it is a little bigger than i anticipated, but nothing that can't be fixed with a cute belt! the embroidery detailing is gorgeous.
Love the design, material, and color...the sizing as listed is waaaaay off (running small). returned to store (after purchase online) 3 times to get one that fits, which was at least generally easy :o
I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!
This is a great casual skirt, i ordered the 0p or xs petite and it fit perfectly. both colors are nice, i don't think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt, so leaning towards the slate color. the fit is also flattering, waist is snug, but not tight. the fabric is soft, could wear in the fall or even winter with tights. i recommend... (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist)
I was looking for a dress that was short sleeved but not sleeveless. this fit my needs--not too short, nice v neck (but not deep), pretty embroidery overall i like the dress. here are a couple of downsides--i wore the dress with tights--and due to the nature of the fabric (cotton) there was no 'glide' and therefore it rode up with the tights. also, it's a bit wide int he mid section. i wanted an 'easy' and not tight/form fitting dress, but this does have almost too much fabric in the mid section
"Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!"
This is a good basic casual skirt, and the grayish color is a great neutral. i saw it in store just kind of hanging by itself and decided to try it on. i usually wear a 6 in skirts, but always have to size up in hd so i grabbed an 8, which fit well. i will say it's definitely a little snug though, even sizing up. the fabric is soft and flowy, and will work well for both late summer and early fall. i'd recommend it.
These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans, and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
Really pretty top. very different colors and style = nothing like anything i have. delivered in timely manner. highly recommend.
Cute top. i always get compliments when i wear it. a little boxy in style
This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress, even with the slip, which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip, wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.
Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.
Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts, but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.
This is a super cute tank- fits good, flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.
The fabric of this top is a tee shirt, mid weight material. it has a nice drape and the color variations along the vee are true to the photo. i purchased size large and it's a bit wide and long for my frame. you could safely size down. the fabric drapes nicely but i didn't like the sleeves or length and it fits large so am returning.
I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front, but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft, but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look, but sadly this is going back.
When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small.
"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up."
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!
Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.
"I took a chance on this in green, extra small (one size smaller than my normal size) because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater. no, it's too awesome to waste as a liner. it's the most amazing cut and fabric. it so flattering and so soft.

please bring back this top!!!!"
I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.
I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!
"Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt.
i highly recommend it!"
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
I purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top. the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute. unfortunately it made my chest look too big... but the quality is really nice and i'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types.
I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!
The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.
This suit is really flattering and comfortable. i love the pattern and the removable strap. the only downside is the top of the suit folds down easily showing the lining at the top. this has been the case with other suits i've bought from retailer, but it's so flattering that i can live with that flaw.
"This top looks elegant with my stirrup pants and feels like heaven it is so soft. fitted at the neck and arms; loose and swingy at the trunk with a beautifully finished hem. the yarn is two-toned heather."
Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.
This dress is a great color, fabric, and the style is very flattering! i'm wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall! dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church!
This sweater just grows on me every time i put it on. it is so comfortable, flattering and literally the perfect winter sweater. the length is long but so comfortable with leggings or skinny jeans. absolutely love it. i have the cream color one and i have to wear a tank under but the material and look is perfect.
"This skirt is stunning. like the other reviewer, i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet. the colors are just striking. it is also flattering - i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk, this one lays nice and flat and looks great. the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom. i am just between 5""3"" and 5'4"" and weigh 112 lbs; i took an xs and it fits perfectly, so it seems true to size. only thing, if you are"
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr"
Saw this in store today and had to have it. the pink is a really bright pink - definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online. i am a solid 10, and i bought this in an 8, so it definitely runs a size large. highly recommend!
To my surprise these vest came with sleeves,but only can zip up halfway,so that armpit will show and it looks like the jacket is ripped at the armpit area! why? that's a good question! it does run very small.i'm 5 feet tall and weighs 115 pounds,luckily the only one left is size l,so i ordered and it fits perfectly!
I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.
Comfortable, decent quality and very casual
"I am not going to keep this dress, just because i am a little too old and need a little more structure for my figure. but it is a very cute, comfy throw-on dress. you could wear tennis, bootles, etc. 
especially great for a pretty slender person,..then the loose flowy style is still attractive"
The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.
I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'"
"It is a beautiful dress, light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4"" 34c, 134 lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me, but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress."
I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate, i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
"I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still
fit. overall the medium was more flattering on me. so i recommend ordering your regular size. it is such a pretty v"
I've wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now. the material is perfect and the colors are amazing. it's definitely a vest that you can wear all year. i would 100% recommend this.
Love these pants -- the colors, style, fit. however, this is the second pair of retailer active pants i've ordered that i've discovered had a hole in them. these are not cheap pants, so the poor quality is inexcusable.
"1. i agree with the other reviewer. the photos do not do this shirt justice. it's very cute and fits well. the photos on the models are terrible.

2. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size medium fit me perfectly. i'm often in between a m and l for cloth and stone, but the medium fit well, which means it runs a little big.

3. i wanted a plain white shirt with a little interest, and the side buttons add that. it also means this is not a tuck in shirt, but more of a tunic."
Pretty, easy-to-wear dress. loose fitting. i am typically a size 4, size 4 fit, but i might have been able to go to a size 2 if i wanted it to be more fitted at the chest/arms.
Beautifully made, well constructed and kangaroo pouch gives it character. turtleneck is very low, sweater is very appealing. great buy, especially when on sale.
"I purchased this dress in the red color. overall quality is excellent. the zipper was a little hard to work because the lace kept getting caught in it. the neckline was also too high.  i'm 5'1"" and 107lbs. the dress fit perfectly.  there is was too much nude fabric showing through the dress. i feel that this dress isn't versatile. to me this is somethings that would be great for weddings or bridal/baby showers. due to the lack of versatility and the fact that i wasn't in love with it, i returned"
"Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1"", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!
this is a keeper."
I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny, and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma
"Love this top! with swing/loose tops, i always size down. i'm 5'1"", 115, 34b, and took a 0. it fit very well, i tried a 2 on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat. so size down if you can! i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it, works well!"
This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.
I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me, returned it.
Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!
"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top."
"I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium, size 8, short-waisted, 34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique, appealing design, excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right, the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!), the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme, and finally, admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di"
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!
I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight, but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long, but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it, which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!
I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on, the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
I love the color combination, and the bodice is very falttering. it has a tiny bit of stretch. the tulle is also feminine, i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket... sizing: no need for petite, it was short enough in regualr size. i think petite would have been too short (unless you are younger:-))
I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.
Such quality went in to this dress - it is beautiful. the torso is lined and the tulle is not super poofy at the waist. it is, however, not made for the busty gal. i am a 32 dd, the fabric comes in at the arm pits making for narrow coverage around the chest. also this dress is short waisted, it is almost an empire on me. i wish it worked, as it is lovely. perhaps it will work on the someone super thin? so sad about it!
"For reference: 5'3, 130#, athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders, slim hips)
i wanted to love this dress soooo much, i wanted it for holidays, and special occasions, but my broad shoulders and 34d chest worked against me. the criss-crossed bodice accentuated my larger top, and there wasn't enough poof in the skirt to balance me out. i'm sure this will work beautifully on other body types, and i wish it worked on mine too! a sparkly necklace or dangling earrings and a high bun are all you"
"This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)"
Beautiful and different material, like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.
I don't even know where to begin--this is a dress for all seasons, but especially the holiday season! i bought it specifically for the guise of a holiday part, i can't tell you what a (black) velvet blazer and (black) patent leather heels did for it! the amazing part is that i wore it to work with a cardigan and booties with no problem. my coworkers were amazed but its transition. i have a slim velvet belt with a antique-ish looking clasp that i wore all day with it, too, and that was the cherry
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.
This dress is gorgeous! it is a little sheer even though it has many layers.
Very pretty. runs true to size. waist is higher than in the photo, as other reviewers have stated. correct fit is important because the arm openings are a little big, i thought, and when i sized up to try to get the waist a little lower, the arms were too large.
"This dress fit perfectly, i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high. 
a must have on sale or clearance, but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination, we will see t"
Seems a little small in the width and shoulders. length is fine
This skirt has a beautiful style, cut and pattern. i am so surprised it is on sale - what a great price. it has a medium sweater knit that is not clingy and has a slight flair. looks great with boots!
Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth
I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering, but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
This would be one of my favorite shirts if the neckline were straight across instead of cut, or if it at least had a button. it runs large so the low neck plus bagginess makes it feel too loose for my taste, even though i ordered the xs. the back of the sweater is also really long. it's a comfortable fabric and nice quality though.
"I like this shirt, want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling, it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also, the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi."
The wine color is beautiful, and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however, both fabrics are thin, and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so, if you are the quintessential tall and thin, and you don't mind showing your bra, go for it! otherwise, i suggest skipping this one.
"The fabric and color are very nice, as is the cut, however this is entirely unsuited to someone as short as i (5'3""). i also have a proportionally short torso, so the split hits in the completely wrong place. someone taller is likely to love this."
"This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile, will work for church or cocktail party.
great purchase!"
I really love this top. they show it's as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it's beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.
This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small, but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy, which is perfect for warm days, but the size issue is out of control!
I bought one of these in store and then ordered two more online! i love this top. it's loose and hangs just right. i have gotten so many compliments on it. very comfy and cute. pockets too, which is always a plus.
"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes, it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only"", you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be."
The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical, with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first, it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater, hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second, it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18, but this sweater has lost of
"I got lots of compliments!
fabric is thin but not too thin, perfect for summer and fall. you can roll up higher or even down to full length or ankle (depends on your leg length). 
fit is relaxed but not too loose. these pants are stretchy and very comfortable. i have bigger thighs & calves with small waist and flat butts, i am definitely not a fan of skinny pants/yoga pants, so i often have problem finding the perfect pants that don't show off the silhouette of my bottoms. these pants solved a"
I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size
Beautiful dress, wonderful fabric, very well made, just runs really small! so sad, i wanted this dress for a special event!
I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings,boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.
"Material is slightly thin- good transitional dress for spring or fall. the waist is not quite as fitted as i would like, but the neck and sleeves are perfect. the length is good, but i am short 5'1"" and 105 lbs- xs fit pretty well. a really good purchase- more of a workhorse work dress, and not a wow dress on me, but nice to pair with blazers, jewelry. don't regret the purchase. very comfortable. got compliments when i wore."
This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.
I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.
"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.

i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!

adore."
"I love this dress.
it is so cute!
i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love.
i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs, and medium fits perfectly.
it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full.
the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected, but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing, it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t"
Just bought these. they are my fourth pair. they are comfy, flattering and versatile.  i pretty much live in these cargos on the weekends.
The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes), but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though, because it's a pretty shirt and different.
I always coveted a pair of flower camos that my sister used to wear. they were perfect, fitted, but not too, casual but not too. i saw these and thought to myself that i finally found them, that i didn't have to covet my sister's pants any more. these check all the boxes--comfy, stylish, high quality, but by the end of the day, they bag out. when i wore them, i had to keep pulling them up--a belt would certainly help. so, i love the pants, but am a bit disappointed with how they lose their shape
"Love this top, the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim, love hte colors, but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!"
I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.
I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!
This is a beautiful, simple, yet feminine top. a little tight in the bust on me - so i had to size up (and i am not busty). for reference, i am 117 5'3 34b. i'm probably in between a small and x-small on this - but went with the small.
I had high hopes with the other positive reviews, but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well, and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.
"I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist, but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin, and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference, i am 5'-7"" 155lbs, usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large."
"I love this shirt, i had my eye on it for awhile but wasn't sure what size i'd be, so i went to the store to try. they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest. i got an xs and it was perfect; i am 5'1 about 120 lbs and a small c cup and it fits great. i love it!!"
"I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium, so thought i'd be safe order the medium, which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper."
I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide what's left from my most recent pregnancy. this tunic fits the bill. the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right. i am very petite and bought my usual size xs. i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size, but then it  may have been too short. i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up.
"I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt, but decided to try it on. i loved it on!
it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person, and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full, but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person, but my guess is it may surprise you!"
Love, love, this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.
This top is fun, in a soft fabric - i got the navy ad bright - great for summer. but top does run large, i usually get a medium, but sized down to a small.
This top is absolutely gorgeous, but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.
Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'4 125 lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs, yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric, a bit stretc
This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large, as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite, but this one is a return.
Love this top. it's very comfortable,  and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.
"Love it! can't wait for warmer weather to wear this sassy number!
i'm not sure what kind of bra to wear if any but it it fits so nicely around my bust line that it looks tasteful."
I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others, it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
I love this onesie! i get a lot of complements when i wear it. the only issue is that it's slightly too short in the mid section. it tends to give a tiny bit of a wedgie. but it's not nearly significant enough to give it a bad review or return it. overall it's comfortable. i did have to size up because of that issue but it still looks great.
"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!"
I've never bought a jumpsuit and loved this online so i took the chance and ordered it. i'm 5'7 and 130lbs, i bought the small and it fits great. i love the plastic around the neckline to keep the top in place. the draping fabric on the chest is great for my small chest, gives the look of a fuller chest. absolutely love this. great buy and a great price!
Just as described by others. soft, great fabric and so comfy.
I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!
I was searching for an ivory cardigan and i ordered this in my usual size small and an extra small. after trying them both on, the xs looked better, i like a more fitted look. a tad tight i the arms when layered but otherwise would have been a good fit, but the acrylic in this garment was too itchy for me around the neck. i thought this might be the case but took a chance anyway. also the pockets add a bit of bulk in the hip area, definitely not something i want.
"This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9""."
"Overall i like this sweater, but it does have a couple flaws. the sweater looks better snapped. unfortunately it only has one snap on the front--there should be another one inside. after a couple wears, my snap started to come loose, probably because it pulls so much. the sweater is a bit oversized and i probably ordered the wrong size. i'm 5'7"" and 140 lbs. i ordered a medium, should have ordered a small. all that being said, i still love the look and color (moss green) of the sweater and would"
I saw this in the store and fell in love with it, i didn't buy it at first but i couldn't stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it, its soft and very comfortable, im glad i went back for it.
"I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it, which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6"" and thin, but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25"" in length on my sweater rather than 30"" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa"
I bought this dress for an early fall wedding, i usually wear a size 14 and bought a large. it was loose and swingy, very comfortable, almost too big. i would size down if you are in between. this dress was so easy to wear, i would definitely bring it on vacation. you can pair any type of shoes- flats, sandals, heels, wedges would all look good.
I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. didn't know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend.
I really wanted to like these, but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings, so maybe i'm just not the right target for these, but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking, and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.
"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.
this top is just reall"
I am sadly returning this dress, but i would recommend it! it is soft and i loved the design of the dress. very comfortable. the only reason i am returning it is due to my figure. it is a fitted dress and was a little more revealing that i would have liked.
"I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35"" because i'm only 5'3"" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26"" waist, 34"" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet"
I absolutely love the look and fit of these pants. what is even better is that they don't stretch out while wearing them. i will get a lot of use out of them!
I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.
I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
Very beautiful sheath dress that will be perfect for summer weddings and spring events because of the delicious sorbet pallette.  it's a substantial weight fabric that will nip you in and give the illusion of curves where none exist (in a good way.).  pattern is actually knit into the fabric not printed.  size 8p is the smaller of my size range so for others who are slender on top may want to size down.  if you have prominent hips, stay tts or size up.  if you are very busty, it's tts or size up
I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!
I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!
I have a few of these tees in the short sleeve version and found myself wearing them pretty often so i jumped on the long sleeve option when it went on sale. i bought the black and red (which is more of an orangey red). i love them as well! this top drapes nicely and has a little more style than just a plain tee. the material is thin and while that is nice for breeziness sake, i don't anticipate this will last that long, but thats cool...its not a real investment piece but rather a cute casual t
This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!
These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure
Love the cut of this t-shirt. just loose enough but not big and boxy like so many other tees but not fitted either. nice weight, the hemline is interesting...overall happy with it. just hope it doesn't shrink!
"I never write reviews, but i just purchased this top at full price last week in the store. it's not a have to have top just to look at it, but once i put it on i had to have it. it's extremely comfortable and i am able to wear it while running around with my boys and still feel as though i'm put together. 

i've worn this top now 2 times and after the 2nd wear i have 3 holes in the area where the waist line of my jeans sits. the first time i wore this top it was for only and hour or so. what a"
"I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color, slightly heathered.

what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.

i wore the tank out and about, and it was comfy and pretty. later, though, my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough, it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time, i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit"
I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.
I was looking for a classic, white t-shirt that wasn't too big (i.e. a tunic) or too fitted. this was perfect! i love the irregular hemline and the fit. it's not too tight, but not too big either where it looks messy. just a perfect little tee for any wardrobe. runs true to size. i'm a 34d, size 10 and ordered the medium - it fit great!
I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it!! love the loose longer swingy style and i can't wait to wear again! i may have to get another color!
I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.
"I was looking for a tee that i could wear on the weekends without looking sloppy and also have a little coverage for when i'm feeling a little bloated. (come on, that's what happens sometimes on weekends, ha!) this tee is great because it's got some coverage and it's also not sloppy looking or oversized while still being flowy and flattering. 

the shoulders and arms are fairly tts and there's a slight a-line shape to this tee, so its flattering without being a tent or frumpy looking. i did si"
Most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest, such as gathering, yoke inlay, ties etc. i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part, so it does not add volume to the chest. good for busty figures. pretty top, though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured.
This was really big on me. i am usually a 10 and even the 8 wouldn't stay up around the chest. i would need to have straps sewn on to make this work. on the plus side, the material is absolutely gorgeous. rich, saturated color. too bad about the fit. maybe really busty girls will have better luck, but this is going back. too expensive to justify keeping it if i need to spend money having it remade/tailored.
This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.
I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.
Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly, fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length, just touches top of my thighs.
I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.
I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s, so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it, however some women might be ok wearing it alone.
I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!
I got these on sale mid-summer at retailer and they quickly became my go-to summer slacks for the office. i work in washington dc and jerusalem -- two really hot cities -- and these are comfortable yet professional. with a sleeveless blouse, jacket and heeled sandals they are professional, with flat sandals and a t-shirt perfect for a weekend. they travel quite well and don't instantly wrinkle the way most linen slacks do. think ahead to next summer and grab them.
"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun"
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean."
I loved this top... the color is true to screen. the cut is cute. it's a lovely basic top that has just the right twist to it. i loved the fabric. it is see-through but if you wear a nude colored bra under it nothing shows.
I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out, and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.
"I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :)"
This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!
I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.
"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3"""
"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......
it runs really big
it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.
colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.
fabric feels cheap and stiff
lining is stuff and poorly sewn.
i haven't one positive thing to say about t"
"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature"
Cute and simple.  nice fabric. it's a looser fit so if you're in between sizes i'd recommend the smaller size
As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy, loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.
Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring, summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!
I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back. (there is no retailer near me...) i kept the xs, and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right, but by the end of the day it stretched just enough, and felt just right. really pretty top. i received a lot of compliments on it.
Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!
This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?
I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings, but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
"This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful.
i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias.
i ordered a size two regular, even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length.
---->in the picture, the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model, the sleeves are 3/4 and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are, or if the sleeves reache"
I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me
Very soft for vegan leather. very stylish. i thought it ran slightly small for size indicated on jacket. daughter is 8-10 but medium was tight.
This hoodie is beautiful, soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality, and they've always said i could bring it back)
"I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea. 
material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!"
This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!"
"The collar on this jacket is amazing; there is so much you can do with it to create different styles and looks. it gives it a glamorous edge with a classic uniqueness. the print contains vibrant colors - perfect for holiday parties as well as for work and other occasions. when you snap it, the material gets bunchy and awkward-fitting so it's best to wear it as a wrap. it is a little pricey in my opinion and i am guessing it is due to the perfect and flawless design that stands apart from some of"
I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures, i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy, but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n
"I loved this on the cover of the august catalog. when i saw the pictures online, i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white, and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me. not so. i love it! it fits beautifully; the waistline is very flattering. it looks like a dress a model would wear in the 1960s -- not a hippie, but a model in a high fashion magazine. it looks great with boots. the fabric is soft to the touch, so luxurious. i am of polish and lithuanian d"
"I love the fabric and details of this dress!! i was thrilled to see it in person. i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress. i am choosing to keep the hem where it is, and thus prefer it as a ""colder months"" dress. the poppy flowers really ""pop"" in this dress- love!!"
This jacket is really pretty and unique. unfortunately the material around the waist area does not lay flat like it does in the picture. i'm 5 ft 6 in and a size 6. i ordered the medium. it fit well but the material around the waist area jutted out making me look really wide. disappointed to have to return this.
"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i"
I was lucky enough to see this in store when it went on sale and although i rarely wear leather/vegan jackets i tried it on. i am torn on sizing i'm normally a m or 8/10 in retailer but the m fit slightly tight in the waist and the l was slightly loose. i ended up with the l in the moss color, since i can layer and don't really want the jacket too cropped. i also saw the brown and tried that on but for me the moss color was much richer.
This piece is comfortable and easy to pair with leggings or denim. soft and not too heavy.
Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!
This vest is the best!! even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm. it feels like you're wearing a soft blanket around you. it is my favorite!
"One word: obsessed. feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen. sturdy and luxurious, pretty fancy, definitely queen-worthy. i&amp;amp;#39;m walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab"
This dress is stunning.  it may be my new favorite thing!  i'm not sure where you are to wear this as it is really fancy but i will wear it to work and church anyways--even if it is a bit on the dressed up side.  the fit it true to size.  i am 5'8 and the length is similar to that on the model in the photo. zipper troubles!  i can zip it off of my body--but when one when it comes to the thicker part where the zipper is i cannot zip it--decided could zip halfway and still shimmy in.
I love the long tunic with high slits, it's such a great design. i bought this on sale on a whim. i did see that there was already a small snag on the one i purchased right after i took it out of the bag, must have missed that when i looked at it in the store. i still love it, just a little worried based on other reviews that i won't be able to keep from snagging in the future. at the sale price i would say still worth it though!
I was somewhat hesitant to purchase this dress, based on the previous reviews. for me, it fit perfect. the blouse was fine, not too much fabric. the skirt is soft and stretchy. the fit was tts. for reference, i am 120lbs, 34c and i purchased the 4p. it fits great!
"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart."
I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out, not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it, i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short, it fits well.
"I wanted to love this romper, but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium, decided to return. i still recommend trying this product, but it wasn't for me and my hips!"
I purchased this top in both colors while on sale. it fits true to size. the material is heavier than i expected, but that just means it should hold up for a long time. recommend
This si=hirt actually has a shimmer to the fabric. it is more of sweatshirt material but i like the thickness, not too thick not too thin. the color is nice in person, and has a shimmer to it. i like the detail in the neck too with the sequins. reason i didn't get it is it felt a little big on me (smallest is xs) and also the color wasn't optimal (i am rather pale). otherwise, i do like the shirt.
I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident, oops, meant to be? the color is very nice, not too bright holiday red, but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p, length was not too high/cropped, perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater, so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me, the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs, 30dd,
"I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said ""you look pretty, mommy."" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side."
I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.
"I absolutely love these shorts. i do, however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24, 25, 0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available, but that was not an option. they are a little baggy, but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on."
Very happy with the fit of this sweater, which is flattering and unique. the ruffle elevates the piece. very soft and a good length for me (i got a medium) in both the sleeves and the body. the hole at the neck gaps a little, which may bug me as time goes on, but otherwise i am so pleased with this sweater that i am willing to put up with it. i ordered this in the red, which is more of an orangey red, which does not suit my skin tone. i will exchange for the blue/gray version.
This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.
This is a very well made top, i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.
"Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)"
"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p"
I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p, as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015, and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p, it was much too
"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!"
This is cute! i was hesitant to buy, but glad i did. it has a unique cut. the fit is tighter to the body, but it's very flattering. i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color. the blue seems more on the gray side to me, but it is mottled and really pretty. the neckline comes all the way up - as shown. the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool. i love it. pair it with a skirt or jeans. adorable!
This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!
I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.
These pants were pretty different then my typical style, but i love them! they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs, but i still think they are cute- especially with a heel or clog. good quality, well made.
My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.
Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j
"This is a beautiful dress and i would recommend.
but it was short on me (tall), not the midi i was hoping for. and a little too low cut (too much cleavage), i'm a d cup.
since i paid full price, i have to be completely pleased with my purchase, for this reason i will return. 
maybe if i had bought it on sale price, then i would keep."
I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
Ordered a petite and it was not as dark of a denim like the picture. the pockets on the backside are wide and are not flattering if you have any curve to your rear. makes you look wider than you are! pocket on front are also large, which accentuate thighs. these were returned immediately as it did not work for me.
I tried the green one on in the store, as my store only had the green. the lace was sort of fuzzy-looking and i couldn't tell if the items were shop-worn or if the lace was supposed to look like that. since they all looked that way, i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on. i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and v-neck. a bit dressy but casual also. although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area, in this case the design was too loose a
"I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs.
i was a little worried the small might be too long &/or tentlike (i probably would have ordered a petite small had it been available), but it fits great!!!
i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!"
"I just love everything about these jeans, and everyone that sees them on me seems to as well! i'm short (5'2"") and was concerned about the length on me because they didn't have the petite in my size- but these seem to be just fine. i wear them with a bit of a heel, so that helps. they fit snugly (but not too tight) in all the right places, i have a bit of a backside so that's a plus for me! because of the higher waist, they also don't ride down.  except for the shorter length, they remind me a l"
Bought this dress as good transition piece into our hot fall. don't usually go for the uneven hemline. but got so many compliments, i'm expanding my comfort zone.
These pants are so perfect, i bought 3 pairs. perfect for casual friday's, a night out or the weekend.
"This dress is gorgeous in color and print; i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as you'd like. definitely runs big in the shoulder/bodice area, so i sized down."
"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
These jeans are adorable!  i wear a 10p and the 30 petite fit perfectly. great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats.
"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. 

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good. 

they're also really tight compar"
"These jeans are perfect--exactly what i was looking for. i was afraid the rise might be too high but it was just right, well below the belly button. i abhor anything resembling a ""mom jean"" rise. they will look really chic with boots as well as sandals or flats. i have lots of pants in my wardrobe but i have a feeling this will be a favorite pair."
This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline, but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.
"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips."
I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.
"This dress is simply unique   beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown"
"I saw this in the sales rack and decided to try it on, and i'm so glad i did. it looks very ordinary on the hanger, but, in fact, it's a very surprising find, as others have mentioned.
_____________
pros:
- a-line so you could go down a size for a slimmer fit.
- the zipper in the back has an attached pleather-like tag to help in zipping the dress up. i found this extremely considerate and smart; most dresses don't have this.
- lots of stretch and very, very comfortable. i can see myself wearing"
I love this sweater's rich color and good quality, but the fabric is very thick and heavy, the neck opening is too wide, and the length is too short to be flattering not on my tall (not model skinny) frame.
"I'm typically a 27. this 27 seems snug but there isn't a 28 in petite so i'm keeping these 27 petites. i ordered 27 regular also and they are too long. i'm 5'4"" 128lbs. they are very comfortable. hope they stretch just a tad."
This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite, short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
Loved this jumper, i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach), so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored."
"Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3""/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total), i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full, maybe a little more fitted, which will be more attractive at the top on me.

however, the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer, a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark"
Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo, even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux, i took an xs, whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo, although much looser on me.
"This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit, and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!"
"I've been eyeing this dress for a while now. i decided to purchase it in the rose color, which has absolutely beautiful embroidery. here's why i will most likely return this dress: i'm 5'7"" and it is very short on me (almost like a long shirt), it is extremely roomy, so it doesn't flatter me in any way. if it belt it, it gets even shorter, and the embroidery gets a bit lost in the folds. i'm sad to return it, but i will wait for the next wow piece rather than have this sit in my closet."
"I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry. 


thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar"
"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site."
I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.
Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!
This is such a cute jumper! i bought it to wear to a beach wedding. i took a chance trying on a medium (i'm a true large) and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit! very excited to add this to my spring/summer repertoire!
I am 5'4, so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p, (about 125-130lbs), and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue), i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels, with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey, but worth it.
This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!
I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf. i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc... they make me feel sunny and happy :) fabric is light and flexible but stays in place (went running in them) size is accurate, i am usually a 2 on retailer pants/skirts, 27 on jeans, and the small was perfect.
"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular, as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway, i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well, and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly, i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place."
"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect."
I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.
"These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great
the tie dye is very unique love it!"
Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
I bought this top in my usual size large based on other reviews and it fit perfectly.   i have long arms and the sleeves are the perfect length.  the fabric is a slightly stretchy jacquard and very nice quality.   the top is definitely more fitted with a significant amount of fabric at the peplum portion.   i wish that this was a bit less, which is why i only gave it 4 stars.  otherwise, it's a great top for fall that can be dressed up with a pencil skit or more casually with jeans.  definitely
I absolutely adore peplum tops, although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric, which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on, with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski
The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.
Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a 5 hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik
I am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it on-line. however, it immediately caught my attention in a store, i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing. soft, warm, skin hugging material, long skinny sleeves and more importantly, i looked amazing in this dress.i think colors are more vibrant, design is more lively in person than in picture. i am 5'10'' 145lb, so i loved that intricate dress pattern, broken lines in front made me not look li
"Great strapless maxi. purchased for a late august wedding being held at a yacht club, will fit the nautical theme perfectly.  i'm typically a size 8 and ordered the medium size -- fit is a little snug on top for my 34dd chest but waist and hips are spot on.  length is long, totally skims the floor for my 5'6"" height.  i plan on wearing it with red patent leather wedges so it'll help keep the hem off the floor and make me look longer.  quality is outstanding, strong zipper, quality fabric, excell"
"This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person. 

very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping."
"Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave"
Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i
Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches, 38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top, and that works perfectly with the design.
Great pair of black pants, a step up from basic leggings. nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides. would recommend.
This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.
"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging."
I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.
This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal, but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit, the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.
"I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2"", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights."
They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.
All the colors are beautiful, the white is a true white. i got the gray one. it runs large, so i would recommend sizing down, unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath.
Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
"After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2"", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t"
I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.
"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big."
I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet
This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.
"For an athro top, this is a good price point, especially for such a beautiful piece. it's really just a basic tee, but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and it's much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- i'm normally a size small and got that size with this (34d, 124 lbs., 5'4"", 36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer, i really couldn't see my nude bra through it, so don't feel i'll need a cami, because that would ruin the delicate design of this."
I think this is the first peasant top i've found that doesn't fit like a tent! i did size down to a small, although i'm normally between small and medium. i even found that the shape of this top is quite flattering. maybe the darker embroidery helps. i'm very happy with this purchase.
On the hanger i thought this had a chance, but oh geez... puffy sleeves, itchy, metallic thread, lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no, no, no.
Beautiful shirt! i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it! it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material. the peplum is also not overwhelming. it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels. my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything?
Soooooo cute. fit like a dream. look like regular pants. could dress up or dress down. i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable. going to buy in the black as well. normally wear size 4-6 got the small and fits perfect.
Love everything about this top.  the ruffles give the top a great edgy style.  will look great with some skinny jeans and boots.
"Fit review: i ordered the size 27 as i read alexa chung jeans run small, and my usual size in ag stevie is a 26 in cords, 27 in some jeans.
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 25"" waist, 33"" high hip, 37.25"" at the widest, 29"" inseam. i have more of a pear shape than an hourglass, flatter stomach, bigger upper thighs and bottom. i'm long-waisted and do have some high-rise trousers that look great, which is why i risked paying shipping on these.
.
the 27 was loose at my natural waist, the jeans measuring 29.5"""
Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft, has a great shape, and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.
Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.
"I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really
nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am
5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it
would have ruined the details of the dress. they were
backordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it."
Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully, irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6, an a cup, 150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.
I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!
"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand, so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7"", 128#, 34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price."
Purchased the cream color in my local store. it looks great with jeans or leggings. i've worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too. it is very comfortable, runs big, but it's meant to not be fitted. the addition of pockets, (that don't stick out), makes me love it even more! i will be wearing this from fall to spring. great design, retailer!!!
This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.
"Beautiful detail in the bodice... but i'm either too short or it's a bit too long for me. ;) have not yet decided if i ""can"" keep it. material is elegant, details are beautiful."
I ordered this online with fingers crossed, in my usual size m. it fits well, albeit a tad snug (although very flattering on my curvy frame). it is an unusual color for me, but i ended up loving it in person where you can really appreciate all the detailed woven patterns in the fabric. there is a slip underneath which ends several inches above the hem.
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
"I am an retailer employee. i immediately fell in love with this dress. i tried it on and it was way to long, as always with regular store sizes...i am short 5'0"". i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month, i ordered it anyway. my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size. i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there. i purchased a 2 petite which is the size i"
I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.
I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!
Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections, flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.
This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.
I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!
Yes, this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works. i like the gray/white pattern. received compliments upon first wearing and know i'll wear it often. i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily. this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting. still i'm glad to have it in my fall wardrobe.
"This dress is really lovely and the quality seems excellent. the bodice of the dress fits tight and that is why i knocked off one star. i am a 34 a 5'6"" and 123 lbs., ordered the 2, my usual size. the top part is very snug and it hugs tightly around my neck which i don't like. i may try going up a size but it fits so perfectly everywhere else. the length is perfect it just touches the ground, no need to hem it even with flats. the color may be a bit more of a peachy color in person but overall t"
Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!
"This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.

it's also not made very well."
This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.
My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much. perfect tunic length, swingy, detailed...but as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it. i just got it and im in love! the orange print is so lovely. the perfect fall color and the print is timeless. the fabric is light and easy. the fit is definitely bigger, but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl. i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room, but i needed the xl for room i
I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
Great fit, wonderfully made, and priced just right.
"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.
the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size."
Although this is a very lovely dress in the pictures, and it has a lovely quality in person, the shape and orientation of the dress is very awkward. the attached slip makes it tricky to put on, and the sizing between the top and the hips seems inconsistent (tight in the hips, large in the top). not quite for my body type - maybe better for someone with slim hips and a bigger bust.
I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.
I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.
Gorgeous dress, soft + silky material, and flattering on most body types. best purchase i've made at retailer in a long time, i get compliments every time i wear it!
-i normally don't go for these tops because with my hourglass frame and wider hips, it only makes me look wider. however, like others, i was drawn to the fabric and feel.the bottom half really is lovely and looks expensive, and the top half is stretchy an
Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.
I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well
What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am
I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may! i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on. i'm not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing! the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch. the waist is a little high (it's similar to the picture online) but i'm also 5'10 so it mi
This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
Great top to dress (further) up or down. it does, however, run large and the straps seem (too) long. if you are a petite you will not be able to wear a regular without alterations.
"Love this maxi! gorgeous print, flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit, but with a tan this dress will be perfect!"
"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.

i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back."
If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!
"I wanted to love this dress - everything about it was so beautiful - except the fit , the length, the neckline ... i tried on a 4, 6 and petite 4. i'm 5'5"" 130 32dd - the top of the dress runs small/tight - so i needed to try it on without a bra.
the length on the regular is to the floor/with the petite to my ankles. the print was beautiful and like in the photo, it flowed nicely but there was just too much fabric - maybe it was just the design for me - it did nothing for my figure at all"
I love this tunic.  it is so comfortable and looks great with leggings and boots.  perfect fall look.
"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -"
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.
I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well, bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm, but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going
I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.
I love ag jeans and these are fabulous! i can't say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time. i have several pair. i purchased the royal blue color in the store. they held their shape all day and were super comfy. i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time.
I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between, size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6
"I'm super happy with this dress! it's extremely well made, very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done. this dress is cotton but doesn't look cheap or too casual; it's one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down. this will absolutely work across seasons, with leggings and boots/booties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around. i do feel like it runs a little large, but again it's 100% cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash"
Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
Got this poncho for christmas and loved it the moment i got it out of the box!! great quality and looks great cant go wrong with this purchase.
I ordered this vest in xxs, since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then, the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big, not artfully drapey.
I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other
I am 5'3 and weigh around 150 and the medium fit me perfectly, hit me just below the knee cap. it's cotton/linen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be. it's double lined, made from a quality fabric. thicker but still very much breathable. will see how this holds up in kansas city's 95 degree summers but so far mid-80's it's been just fine. i'd definitely recommend this skirt. the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets!
This vest is a great fall item. the asymmetrical design and unusual buttons really give it interest even though it is black. you could wear it open or closed, both look cute. appears to be high quality.
I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper, thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere, so i was happy about that. still, it is made with slub
I have the t shirt from last year and i love it so could not wait to try the dress. why didn't you make it in petite? it can work with some tailoring but petite sizing esp since this runs on the big side, would have been ideal. love the navy, will try the white. how about some more colors and petite?? please??? more t shirt dresses in general too please!!
I have been looking for a cold shoulder dress for a while, but haven't been able to find anything i really liked. i ordered this and picked it up at the local store. it is very comfortable and seemed a little big at first, so i washed and dried it and it seemed to shrink just a little to fit well. i love the open shoulders. i wore it with gray tights and gray boots for valentine's day and it was perfect for the cold winter weather. i think it is a bit overpriced, but i still love it! it's a nice
"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.
-------------------------
that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long"
Very sweet color , will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .
Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.
I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.
"Bought them in store and have worn them twice. very flattering! they have maintained their shape through the day. i'm 5/4"" and usually wear a 31"" inseam, and these are perfect ankle length. i'm tempted to buy another color!"
I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned
Love another pair of ag stevie's!
I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.
This vest is very nice and fashionable, very stylish. i like it a lot. however, it is too itchy. the opening in the front didn't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold. however, the itchiness is too much. i don't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere, so i could not imaging wearing this vest, it is too itchy. why ruin such a good thing?
"These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon), 7% polyester, and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump, and stretch out. 
.
these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton, 18% modal, 2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton, at least in the stevies.
.
i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs, b"
"This is definitely one that looks better on than on the hanger. i am 5'10"" so it is a little too short for me to wear with bare legs (it tends to ride up) but it looks great with boots and tights. i love the raw edges of the striped a-line part. i have also worn it belted and that is also a very cute look."
"The colors are amazing, the fabric is beautiful; my only complaint is the cut. i am 5'8"" 130 lb and always a medium. i put the sweater on and the armhole area was short so it kept riding up- it almost fit like a petite with the higher cut in waist tailoring. i liked the sweater color and fabric so much i exchanged for a large."
"These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2"" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties, which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24"". i don't know if that's true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that's around a 26"" inseam, but definitely a great length and i don't need to hem. the leg opening isn't too big, so i can roll it up/cuff them to get"
I loved the blue brocade since it's a little unusual, paired with a top that brings an otherwise formal fabric into something you could wear out to dinner, plus a little pop of extra color from the ribbon! my biggest fear ordering online was that the top would look cheap - fortunately it doesn't. the top of the dress was fitted (i wore my usual size). what i didn't expect, though, is the skirt is really poofs out a lot below the ribbon, which runs just below the bust. the photo online shows a li
The best thing about these pants is the material. if you are expecting a bleached denim-material, these are not for you. these are far better. they are extremely soft and have some give to them but not so much that they stretch out while wearing them (as guaranteed on the tag). although, because they are a less rigid material, the pants do show stretching as can be seen at the knee area in the photo. if you normally get short-sized pants, the regular fit will fit like regular non-ankle pants but
"I purchased these jeans because they were on sale and i figured they'd be a good alt to my other white denim jeans. these have by far exceeded my expectations! my fav jeans, period. i'm 5'2 1/2"" but have a long torso and though west size 25, am athletic and curvy, so petite jeans don't really work for me. these are just the best cut and fit!"
I was excited to find this on sale because i just love baily 44, their designs are always simple, beautiful, and comfortable, and this one, just like the other 2 baily 44 dresses i own is perfect. i am 5'9, 125 pounds, and 34b bra size and got my usual size, xs. unlike my other baily 44 dresses, this one has a more relaxed fit up top and then has a form fitting layer that shows off your curves on the bottom. i personally don't think it's too short, but then again plan to wear tights with this pi
"Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into). 

it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional."
This dress is such a crazy beautiful color, the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it, and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice, but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest, but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either, so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway, but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
These jeans look great with everything and fit great. i can dress them up with wedges or throw them on with flip flops and they are so comfortable, too. i've had many compliments already.
I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch
"This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached, which i appreciate...no fighting with straps, etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"", 130 lb, 34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy, just to give you an idea of my shape."
I love, love, love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!
"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
I'm bought this dress at 16 weeks pregnant and am loving it! the top drapes, but is still form-fitting enough to show off a little bump. i've received so many compliments. the skirt is short, but i love it, makes legs look great with tights! i sized up a little to allow for room to grow.
"I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding."
I'm 5'5 and curvy body shape, bought size 6 because i want it to be a bit loose, turns out i could go with size 4 too, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse.
I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size 4 (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!
Love this layered turtleneck dress. super cute and super comfy. love the contrastin pattern and fabric of the top half and the skirt. also the skirt is very hip hugging as shown in the photo, with the result being flattering. i wore it to work with sweater tights and boots (winter in seattle) and felt completely put together.
"I love the pattern and style of this top. it is a flattering cut, however, it was way too short. i am 5'6"" and small usually fits me without issue. sadly enough i had to return it."
I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
In the photos i have a different tank underneath than the one that comes with the shirt. i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!
Like everyone else, i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it wasn't until  i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so haven't been able to wear it much, but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it's classy and can dress up any outfit.
"Beautiful color and flattering fit on me. i bought the size 4 and it fits my 5'5"" 125 lb frame perfectly. i love that it has sleeves!! no worries about upper arms. it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk. it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile. i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too. love it. worth every penny.."
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?

the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.

one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve"
"These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"", they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable."
I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.
"I'm a curvy size 8, and these pants fit 
beautifully. 
they're a fairly narrow (cropped) leg, with a slight flare. i'm happy and ordering another pair."
"Nice soft jeans, cute style, and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need. 
if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type"
This is a very light, flowy dress. the lining is very fitted, but the dress is actually not fitted. it has a nice flow, but hits right at the thigh area before flowing out. plan to wear it to work.the color is very bright and pretty.
"This top is lovely, but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor."
"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin, and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides, i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick, the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus, the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4"", and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!"
It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!
This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!
I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places
This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.
"I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.

and i have wide shoulders.

30dd chest, 26.5 in wasit, big legs, 115 lbs."
"This is definitely a cute top! i am 5'1"" 34a, and bought the extra small. it fits well, very flowy. a little shorter than i like, but it still looks cute. it's thin, but soft and comfortable. i wore it just like the model, with my long jeans and some wedge sandals and it looks great for a spring day!"
Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes
I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!
"Dress is so comfortable. great for town or resort. 5'7"" size 6 34a and i got a size small."
"Gorgeous sleeves, flattering neckline...and a voluminous torso. i loved the fit of the top portion so much, i decided to buy it, knowing it would require alteration. the seamstress removed a *significant* amount of bulk and added vintage buttons to clasp the inverted pleat. i find many of these ""easy breezy"" tops create a shapeless look. extra volume in both the front and back creates a needlessly rotund profile. despite excellent posture, i looked both hunched and pregnant in the unaltered silh"
Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece
I am a fan of flutter sleeves, always have been. however, at 42 years old i sometimes feel as if i can't carry them off. not the case with this shirt. bordeaux has found a way to balance just sleeve with femininity and maturity. i'm a size 12 in jeans and tops. i ordered s large and it fit beautifully. very flattering.
Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident, thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater, leggings, and boots all winter long and then when the wea
This shirt seemed to run really small, especially in the chest. i'm debating exchanging for a new size bc this was really cute but i'm not sure if i need to go up 1 or 2 sizes it was so tight
I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly, but a little baggy under the arms, and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight. i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long. i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally. i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer. i got the green and am really happy with the color.
Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.
I recently came across this dress in store and decided to try it on. i immediately fell in love. my husband was patiently waiting outside the dressing area to see it and give his opinion but i knew i was going to get it regardless of his thoughts. :) this dress could be worn with heel, flats, sandals, booties, etc. the one drawback i have is the high cut of the wrapover in front. as other reviewers have said, i plan on wearing this places where i won't be sitting for long periods of time because
I see that many of you, like myself, fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater, and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy! i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding (it will sound strange, but it worked like a charm!) fold up the sweater, seal it in a ziploc bag, and pop it in the freezer for 24 hours. bam! it will shed no more! now i can completely love this sweater. :)
I bought this sweater in the green and loved it so much i ended up ordering the pink also. it looks great with jeans or with a pencil skirt. the silhouette is flattering and the sleeves, though big, don't get in the way while i'm working. i'm a little worried about the looseness of the knit and the amount of lint it shed at first, so i don't know how long it will look and feel new. also, one of the buttons on the pink one was hanging by a thread when i first pulled it out of the package. at this
I really love how comfortable and versatile this dress is. the midi length is perfect for booties or flats, and the cowl neck is loose and fluid, so it lays well. the only complaint i had, and it's minor, is the tulip skirt doesn't stay closed well when i walk or sit, which reveals more inner thigh than i am comfortable showing. i have to be very mindful of the skirt all day (i teach high school).
I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.
Beautiful top but the angles emphasized my widest fluffy bits in an unattractive way. i ordered size large. the material, fabric and lace are pretty and well done. my arms looked huge too. and the piece under the arm hit below my bra and it was clearly visible by a couple inches. i carry my weight in my mid section and am short waisted. think this would look best on taller, thinner bods.
Great structure
I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog, but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
.... it sheds on my cloths something fierce! not much i can do as i don't want to return it because i love it so. i love the longer panel in the back and the side slits. nice weight and feel, i just wish it didn't shed so much!
Soft, versatile comfort. what more could you want in a legging?
I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi
"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however, is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the"
This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.
Saw this in the greenville, sc store, and it caught my eye. i ordered a petite a week later, and i adore it. nice embroidery. a little sparkle. the sleeves are voluminous, but it makes me feel sassy.
Picked this up on sale - was on the fence about the bright reddish/orange coloration, but it really says summer and goes so easily with multiple summer pieces. it is generously cut and made very well. i've worn it on cooler/rainy days and it really brightens everything up. best part is that it launders well too.
This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!
Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!
This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.
"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees."
This top is a mix of materials - a silk and more of a t shirt material. i purchased for dressier wear but the material makes it more casual. i like the sale price so i'm keeping!  size down, runs a tad loose.
I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however, the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality, but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want"
I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.
This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected, but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.
Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like, this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.
Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.
I purchased the blue one - it's a very brilliant royal blue. nice color. the patterned portion is quite heavy, which provides a nice drape. hangs really well without being clingy or too loose. great top for jeans.
I got the purple version in a xs. i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal. i usually don't wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail. very feminine. it also hides the tummy roll, so that is always a plus! i've worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling, but easy fix.
This is a cute top and i did not even need my usual petite size thanks to the 3/4 length sleeves. i liked the semi-abstract sailboat pattern and the style is comfortable to wear. however, the tie at the neckline didn't appeal to me so ultimately i did not buy it.
"This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.

sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands, and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso, narrow across the shoulders, and short arms. 

fit: loose fitting t's l"
"An adorable tank...wearing it right now!
fits this curvy girl well, though may consider wearing a tank underneath, as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage.
if in between sizes, consider sizing down.
perfect print for summer."
"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well."
This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.
The shape is awkward, too loose, not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.
I love the way this dress fits and flares in all the right places making it one of the most flattering dresses i've tried in a while. for me, maeve dresses tend to run a bit big, so i sized down to a small (i'm typically an 8-10). the colors are a little deeper/richer in person, which made me very happy. i love the flounce in the skirt - it adds more swing to the dress. the only draw back was the v-neck came down a bit low. easy fix with a cami for work.
I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.
"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said, i think this top fits really well, and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small, and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest, and i'm a 34d. (5'4"", 124 lbs, 36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue, however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po"
This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.
I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!
I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.
This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy, otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.
"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!"
"The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin"
Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.
I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think
"I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket."
Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering, but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered,but you may risk losing the flare, which is unfortunate considering the price.
I am somewhere between a size 6 or 8, so i ordered this dress in a size small. mistake. too small. the color of this dress is so lovely. it's between red and orange. will probably order it in medium.
I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.
I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!
"Love, love, love but alas had to return. gorgeous fabric and elegant design, i purchased for an evening summer wedding. however, the cut of this dress is more suited to a small bust line and a short waist. i felt like it hit at my rib cage and not my natural waist and my top half was spilling out of the neckline. it was slightly loose so i don't think sizing up would have helped. maybe i needed to size down? i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs and had the 10. loved but it didn't fit me properly. also noticed the"
This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!
"I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer! 

one reviewer said she didn't like the placement where the dress fell, i have a short torso and long legs, so i like to try to emphasize a"
Adorable, comfortable piece. runs slightly big.
For reference i am 5'3 and 120-123lbs. i wear a size 6-8. the quality of material on this skirt is very good and quite heavy. the waistband has a little stretch and the skirt is lined. there are pockets. longer on me than the model which is fine because i'm wearing it to work. this skirt has no black ( it's dark navy and brown) in it and will not look good with black tights which how i wear skirts to work. can be worn with no tights it's a made of substantial curtain like material. i'm keeping i
Wore this dress for my bridal shower and got a ton of compliments! it fits great and is very well made!
I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve
Yes,you need these, so comfortable - and wash up perfectly - workout, walking or great to sleep in
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.
Great summer shirt. loose fitting, but especially wide. the button gather in back is a nice detail
Perfect for end of summer going into fall. very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties. still trying to find a sweater to layer it with. runs true to size. i am an xs/0 and got the xs. i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this. it fits perfectly and comfortably.
I'm 32b-26-36, straight and slim, and the 0 fits like a glove. it's a nice change from all these loose, billowy (sometimes sack or tent like) dresses. if you are busty or have a broad rib cage, you'll need to size up for sure. the slip is fitted and im wondering if it will stay put. love all the colors in this dress - navy was better for me, the white washed me out and was just underwhelming. the band of lace hits high on my waist at a spot that is flattering and slimming which doesn't happen of
These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids
The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful. it will be great with leggings, jeans, or even a straight skirt. i would definitely recommend this sweater.
These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
Thee are beautiful pants. so soft to the touch. true to color. ca.t wait to wear them in the fall.
"This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not.
returning."
This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
This is a very slimming, well-made, nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
"This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small, sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25"" long instead of the 35"" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two."
"I love the peplum tanks that retailer puts out, but sadly this one did not work for me. the print is vibrant and the colors are even brighter in person, the the material made it look cheap. the fit in the bust was off - i felt that it cut too much into the bra area. and the poof part of the peplum hit me at a weird spot on my torso. really wanted it to work, but maybe it would look better on someone more slender/taller than me (for reference i'm 4'10"" and usually wear size l in retailer)"
It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.
When i got this top in the mail i was impressed by the colors. they were very vibrant and i loved the feel of the material as well. however the top did not look good on. i have an hourglass figure with a dd+ bust, and the peplum just made me look like i didn't have a waist. the arm holes were also very big and showed my bra. overall i think this is a very cute top, but would probably be better on women with more athletic figures.
I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter, it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again, i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also, i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable, but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
I picked this up on sale and was glad i did - the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast. the fit is right on, but size up if you are unsure or inbetween. the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt. the fit is boxy - but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design.
"Great casual pant for the summer. wish there were more colors. white or beige would be great. comfortable. great fit. sizing is consistent with my normal designer denim sizing; 26. i'm also 5'3 and the regular size pant is just right for me."
I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater
I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.
I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.
"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips, and the dress (size m for 140 lbs, 5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric, like other reviewers - honestly, even if there were a snag or two, the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible, depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f"
I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top, not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.
Wore this dress for easter dinner and received many compliments. it is delicate and if not careful the diamond pattern can snag. i loved the comfort and ability to dress up or down. i ordered the regular instead of petite as i wanted the length at my knees not thigh high. and it fit perfect at 5'4.
This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34
I ordered this dress in two sizes, pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also, the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.
So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug, so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!
Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.
Very nice material, soft and feminine colors. however, the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable. unfortunately it's going back
This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape, but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
Ordered my regular size 27. they were tight when they arrived but they stretch - a lot. i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear.
I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!
I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress, church dress. however, it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust, and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee, but sadly, that wasn't the case.
This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.
I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.
I really love this dress! it's very flattering and comfortable, and all the buttons keep the wrap in check. i've gotten lots of compliments on it. also, it's got pockets!
Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!
I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year. both were loved! great style and quality will hopefully make this a go-to sweater for both recipients.
I would have loved this tee but the color didn't love me. it's sort of a mustard orange. the embroidery is beautifully done but i felt the size of the yarn tassels were too big and looked a bit odd, but i have a large bust so don't like to draw attention there. it's a sweatshirt and not a tee shirt, but it flows and doesn't grab anywhere. it looked so nice under a jean jacket. if it weren't for the color and tassels, it would be a keeper for me.
Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!
I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt, however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have), so i ordered it in the regular small. it's perfect in length, but a little loose on top, which i'm fine with. overall, very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.
Nice warm long cardigan that can work for many seasons. works well over a dress.
This top is as pictured. i'm 5 feet 120 pounds. the small petite was a great fit. the material is cozy, soft and somewhat thick. dress it casual with jeans or elevate it with slacks.
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!
I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.
It is such a cute dress. the mulit-colored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it. the dress can be formal or informal, and it works for a myriad of occasions. please purchase it!!!!
"This is a lovely sweater - the ""moss"" color however is really camel, which is what the photo indicates. it fits tts, is all cashmere, and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo. i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater - one that features interesting decreases, lines, and angles. it is very soft, warm, and lightweight, and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed"
I was excited to see this dress as i'd bought the sparrow boiled wool sheath dress in xs last year and loved the fit. however, this dress does not fit the same way. the top fits fine, but the waist and the bottom are way too big. i laid it over my sparrow dress from last year, and the bottom is at least an inch wider (two inches, if you go by the total circumference). i'm planning to exchange for an xxs and see if that one fits better.
I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais
"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!  

this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.   

the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece."
This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.
This piece is very comfortable and feels well made. it is not slimming.
"I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9"" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase."
"First, i love wool. if it's 100% wool, i love it. if wool isn't your thing, then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets, which i love. with the sleeves being short, i am wearing a long, frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice, but runs large through the hips. however,"
This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.
Loved that this was an 100% boiled wool dress but unfortunately runs very large. i tried the small and extra small - both were really large in the hips. i will maybe try the xxs - was hoping to make this is winter staple.
Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater, did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus, it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available, and lets say i was swimming in the xl, much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two, the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl, seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well, however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely, the suit has boning on the side of the bust, and also the silicone grip on the top edge,
I love this shirt!  it's super comfy and i love the design and detail.  it does run large, so order a size down.
"This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres"
"The dress is great for pear shapes. however, i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable, not too thick or thin. however, i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo."
I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc
"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else"
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
Got this in gray, pretty good quality, all around good basic.
I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on, with the lines running down vertical, giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on, and has nice, large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on, and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference, i'm 5'7"" tall, and weigh close to 130 lbs., and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice, but i"
This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper
I generally wear a 27. jeans fit perfectly. skinny, but not too skinny.
I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.
I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric, it is tacky!
This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.
These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.
I think this dress is very pretty and i like that it's made of silk.  i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy.  what i don't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress.  the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back (you can see similar in the model shot from behind).  for the price i was expecting a little more quality control.  i also do not care for the lining.  i do not think the off white is
What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!
I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light, comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable, too!
"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!"
I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this
I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews, i think this dress runs large. i am a 4 and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!
This dress rules.  so comfy, and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats, wedges, booties, boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either, i am a 34c.
I got one of these tanks, and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray, green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me, but that's no problem. the shirts are darling, they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way, but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow, and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones, i don't love bright colors but i love the green, white
Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.
"I'm 5'8"" and 130 and this made me look huge. it was a small but too billowy. it is pretty, nice fabric and well made but i returned."
I bought a xs in black. i like the weight, texture, and thickness of this fabric. it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well. may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch, which could mean there are inconsistencies? i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes. it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length. but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale.
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.
"The dress is very pretty, however the description is deceiving. i purchased it not just for the look but because it was listed as ""silk"" but that is not exactly true. the under-slip is silk but the outer dress, what you see is definitely not. it is a cheap, thin material on top, skirt is stiff,, not loose or flowy as the picture would have you think. i will keep it, very happy i did not pay full price."
This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
"Love this top.
perfect under a jacket for work or on its own for date night. i have a long torso and the length is perfect. so dainty and different!"
I purchased this dress for myself. however, when i tried it on at home the length was too short. i gave the dress to a relative who is petite and the dress fit her perfectly.
"I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a"
I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
"These jeans fit great, but i think getting the right size is key. i bought my usual denim size 26 and at first i thought they were too tight. but as the day wore on, they softened and conformed to my body and fit like a glove. if i bought them in a larger size, i'm afraid they'd bag out like jeans tend to do. i think it's the ""legging"" style that makes them so form fitting. i wish they were ankle length like on the model, but i'm 5'5"" and they are quite a bit longer on me than the model."
First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich, deep, gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.
Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
"I had higher hopes for this top and thought it would be fanicer. but as a previous reviewer mentioned, the quality of the material and elastic waistband makes the top look a little cheaper in person. i'm glad i got it on sale with the extra 25% off.

i was hoping to exchange it for a small, but it's sold out by now. the top runs a little large. normally i'm between a small and a medium, but i think a small might even be too big. i put it on this morning in the dark and by the time i got to work"
"Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit, just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top.
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34""; fuller thighs and bottom, so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.

I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall, thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest, and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one's arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is"
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.
These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!
These are true to size and photo. i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer!
I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type, just not mine. i'm 5'5, 125 and a 34ddd a couple weeks post partum. thought this could be a good shirt while i'm nursing bc it's flowy but stylish. unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on. the cut drew all attention to my big chest---not in a good way--and distracted from my smaller lower half. made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am. probably good for small chested girls, very tall girls or curvy on the
I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on! they must be magical pants, because they are slimming and very flattering! amazing jeans!
"I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.
it is cute though!"
I spend most of my time searching for the perfect pair of jeans (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but only slight). finally, the the ag stevie's are it. this is my third pair. now, for more colors...
I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall.
"I agree with the first reviewer. this dress is just ok; nothing to write home about. if you need a throw on dress in a pinch, it's nice to have on hand, but there are probably a lot of other retailer dresses that fit the bill that are better quality than this one. it is also very body conscious in the back. the material is a thin, ribbed rayon - on the cheap side. overall, it's a comfortable piece, but it's more like a thin, long-sleeve t-shirt, rather than a quality dress. it would have been a gr"
It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however, it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
"I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.

great buy"
I think these jeans are amazing. they are very flattering and most of all comfortable. i often will go up a size when buying white but i didn't have to with these. they also relax very nicely as you wear them. buying white jeans has always been a challenge, often they are to thin and not that flattering. i don't feel the same about these, they are the perfect summer white jean. i think i need another pair!
I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles, but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle, but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t
Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
This cardigan/sweater/jacket is splendidly soft, wonderfully warm and super stylish. i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings. this piece will be timeless.
I ordered the ivory in xl. when i received it, there was more material than i expected. but, after washing & air-drying, it shrunk a lot. it's pretty and comfortable. worth getting on sale.
Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.
This sweater jacket is beautiful. the picture doesn't do it justice. works very well with a tank underneath and a skirt or over a knee length dress. wore with boots and received many compliments. it's classy.
I loved this top when i saw it online, and ordered it right away. however, the fit is way off. i am always a size medium. always. but i was swimming in this and had to return it. even if it had fit, i wasn't thrilled with it. i thought it would be something i could dress up, especially with the lace detail, but instead it looked really frumpy. i would recommend this top as long as you know to order a smaller size and are looking for something a little more casual.
The dress is very cute, probably more on the casual side. i ordered the 2 petite and it hits me a few inches above the knee, which is what i wanted. the material of the dress and under slip is a little thin, but it looked nice after i ironed it. the top part of the dress looks great and shows off my shoulders nicely.
Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.
I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c
First off, this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt, but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear, but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut, you could wear it oversized without it drowning you, or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia
"I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail."
Ordered this in my usual medium, knowing it was meant to be over-sized. but i could easily have put another of me (138 lbs. with junk in the trunk) inside it! so i'm returning it for a small, feeling sure that there'll still be enough extra for a slouchy look.
This is a very loose fitting style jacket. if you like your jackets oversized, get your regular size. if you prefer the slightly loose (but not baggy) fit like the product photo, size down. as noted by another reviewer, the sleeves are incredibly long. i would say if you are a typical size 0 or 2 (unless you like the oversized fit), you are likely sized out of this jacket. it's a shame, because the quality is great and the windowpane print is beautiful. i'm sadly sized out.
I bought the neutral color. this is a lightweight tunic sweater that can be worn during spring. the lace detail is so pretty...i ordered my normal size small and would have preferred an extra small...the top flows nice but would've been a better overall fit if i sized down. i'm 5'7 140 lbs for reference. make sure you size down at least 1 size.
This dress is super flattering. i love everything about it!
I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.
This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.
Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.
"I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store."
This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it's more sheer, it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume.
"I do a lot of online shopping and, consequently, a lot of returning. when i saw this shirt online i was really excited about it - it just looks very elegant, nice and airy. when the shirt arrived, i almost thought that i should return it, because there was blue lint all over the body and sleeves. turns out that this is part of the shirt; if you zoom in, you can see the blue specs woven in. i didn't end up returning the shirt, because it's extremely comfortable, and i still get a lot of complimen"
Really love the print of this dress and the eyelet detailing around the neck! very flattering!
This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light, a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however, do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash, tumble dry low, and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low, it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order, please take the
"I love these pants. these pants are perfect if you like a slim style, but can't comfortably wear skinnies. i like the heavy weight corduroy fabric and seaming details. i bought the ""wine"" color, but as pictured, it really is rust or copper colored, which i prefer."
"This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well."
Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
Bought this shirt in the black. runs tts, very comfortable and flattering. past left of center shirts in this style/fabric seem to run a little large, but i bought this in my usual retailer m, and it's great. very similar to last years style, but perhaps a tad more fitted. i gave it a 4 for quality b/c i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area, but overall, it holds up pretty well.
"These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris."
"I am 5'3"", 118 lbs and fit perfect in size s petite. good material and flatting!"
"This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?"
Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.
I liked this shirt so much i ordered a second one online in the same size but different color. unfortunately the second one is much shorter than the first and looks less like a tunic or more like a cropped flowy top - not a good look. so the second one is going back. otherwise the shirt would get 5 stars. washes well, super soft and comfy, and looks great with all kinds of bottoms...jeans, cords, leggings. wish it came in more colors. i typically wear a m or l in retailer tops and took the l in th
Perfect for the weekend, purchased the purple, it is a nice soft purple, great with jeans. xs petite was perfect. (115 lbs)
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.
Was looking for a top with this style. i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart (it showed a close fit.) the answer is yes! there's room to spare, which is a good thing. i like the nubby front material and the hemline's asymmetrical style. i'll be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter. very soft feeling fabric. wouldn't mind another one in a different color!
I bought the grey, which is a gorgeous color. i like the long length in the arms (though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very). soft and pretty. i like the length. the back does wrinkle, but i still like the shirt. it's loose, casual and flattering.
It's a little roomy, but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one, whether worn with jeans, work pants, or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said, the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me, i love that, as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny, tiny petite, but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.
This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!
This is a light, so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!
Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
"I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
it is more fitted than last years style."
I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange. it is casual and stylish at the same time. material is soft. great shirt!
"I was undecided whether to get regular or petite. i am 5'4"" but i didn't want it to be sloppy long. ordered the petite xs as other reviewers suggested ordering down and its perfect. length falls on me same as the model above. not heavy and very soft. casual but not sloppy. sleeves are a tad long which i prefer."
I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.
I ordered this shirt last week, and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual, but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black), and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.
I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.
"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!"
After reading other reviews i ordered a small. my usual size is a m. it was huge all around. it's a beautiful print but i think it would make a nice maternity top.
Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.
"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt."
Like the swingy fit. looks nice with a long fitted tee underneath and skinny jeans. the color online says black but it looks more like a faded black like it has been washed too many times.
As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!
Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.
I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
"This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l"
"I had been eyeing this top for awhile so decided to snag it when it went on sale. i'm still on the fence. i love the material and pattern but it is really long, and i'm 5'10"". it looks very roomy with jeans but i still want to try it with tights and boots to see if that looks better. overall i think it is a great piece."
This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.
The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely
In nature pilco fashion, these jeans are amazing. i wear them rolled down, they have a slight boot cut, but not overly. i am 5'10 and the bottoms fall right to my heel- meaning the hem doesn't drag on the ground-finally the perfect pair of jeans. they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day! highly recommend, although a little pricy for pilcro, worth the splurge.
"There were no reviews, it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth"
"This is a darling dress!  it is super flattering . . . except if you are a swimmer and have broad shoulders.  unfortunately i had to return it because it pulled so tightly across my shoulders/chest.  i ordered a size 4 and it was actually true to size other than failing to accomodate for an athletic upper body.  i'm 5'4"", 118 lbs.  wish i could have kept this one!"
I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
I purchased all three colors! this sweater is gorgeous. i love it. it's made well, all three colors are beautiful and it fits great. it's definitely true to size. i'm thrilled with this sweater. adorable!
"This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy, the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small. probably returning."
This sweater is very pretty, i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to, and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!
"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store."
"I tried this on in a store and it was beautiful except the sizing was way off. i'm 5'11"" and usually a 12 or 14. the 12 was skin-tight and the 14 was so loose it was comical - and even on my super long legs, the cuffs dragged on the floor. plus the lacy panels in the cleavage area are totally see-through and my bra was very visible. i was totally bummed. also incidentally, this didn't seem the best quality. there were strings hanging out of the lacy areas, and the waist tie ties way higher than"
"Saw this on the mannequin and tried it on just for kicks:
________
pros:
- breathable fabric, all cotton, with a lovely color.
________
cons:
- runs large, which is the style of the top anyhow. however, i was swimming in the medium (and i normally fit in size 10/12 or m/l tops with retailer stuff. you can easily size down and have plenty of room left. but if you like it really baggy, then stick with your normal size. for reference, i'm a 36c and hourglass and had ample room in a medium.
- s"
"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!"
"I love everything about this sweater. it's well made, the color is lovely, and best of all, i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel ""overexposed"" in the back. i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless, but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant. a must buy at this great price!"
The fabric is soft and the colors are bright. it fits well over the shoulders and the neckline is placed just right on the chest. the bottom portion of the tank is more of a swing style item than a form fitting tank. i am very pleased with the top and will wear it often.
I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried, these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing, i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.
"More importatn, super soft matieral and comfortbale, hwoever, when i put it on, ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric, but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.

true to size, tried on xs, maybe petite would work too."
The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
"This sweater is a pretty color and style and is really soft and comfortable - i really wanted it to work. a small fit my 5'7"", 140 lb frame well (32dd) but the ruffles on the hips were not a wanted addition unfortunately. . tried it on three separate times to try to change my mind but in the end, it's going back. i would not suggest it if you have an athletic or hourglass figure with even a little hip."
This is a pretty dress, although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
"This is a really unique floreat top. unfortunately the petite sizes sold out so i went with an xs. this was too big?too wide in the shoulders and chest, all around actually. my other issue is that it's a heavy material. i just feel like if i was wearing it around all day, i might burn up in it. it did not feel like it was breathable. and finally, i'm 5'2""?even the xs was too long in the back. 

i could see how this could look really cool on the right person?i'm just not that person to pull it"
Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
"Denim, faux fur, flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6""/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback."
Retailerpologists has always carried the best sweatpants. i wish they sold these in more colors. very flattering!
This is a great piece, you can do many things with it. i wore it to work and church :)
I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.
I bought these immediately after trying them on. i was totally surprised to see these very cool, edgy pants at retailer. the color and details are spot on! great quality. i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in. i received a lot of compliments. these look like they should come from europe! i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants.
This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos, but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked, but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns, embroidery and beading. also, it is long and does run large, but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite, and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.
The lace front is more detailed than i expected, but in a good way. the sleeves are softer on the outside, but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said, in my opinion. it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where i'm sitting when wearing it. not a deal breaker though...
I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!
I sized down from my typical size small. beautiful detail on the back. slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that. shorter in front than back but not too short. goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great.
I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric, so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially, going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
I have gotten so many compliments on this top. it does run very large- i'm normally a large, returned for a medium, which is still a bit on the large size. the small was even still large but much shorter so i loved it so much i just took the medium. it's a 'tent' style or 'trapeze' style which doesn't completely show in the images. super nice, thin linen-like cotton and absolutely beautiful. love it!
This top is lovely and so perfect for this time of year when you want to look fall-ish but when it's still too hot to wear long sleeves. but i'm pretty sure it's navy, not black. very dark navy, yes. still, not black. compared to every other black top in my closet it looks navy. so that was a little disappointing. but i'm keeping it because i'm a sucker for a flowy top, and i can wear it right now.
This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!
I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering.
I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :)
I bought this blouse with the 30% off price- i don't think i would pay full price for it, but for the sale price i think it's fair.  as the other reviewers have said, it's definitely navy in front, not black, but it's a nice color combination and can be worn with dark jeans, or with black pants for a more casual work look.  it's sheer, but a dark cami underneath fixes the problem.  i think it fits true to size, with the understanding that it's supposed to be flow-y and loose.
Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.
"I was specifically looking for a nice pair of high-waisted jeans and this pair fit the bill. i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the 4 rating on design, i would have preferred a finished hem. i am 5'4"" and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans. i have had them for a couple of days, still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues."
The longer back makes this one of my favorite pieces for fall. the navy blue pairs well with the floral accents on the back. this blouse is a little too sheer for my liking, but nothing a cami cannot fix.
"This jumpsuit is absolutely beautiful. it fit like a glove and made me feel incredibly classy and sexy at the same time. i am 5'4"" and ~120lbs and the 4 fit like a glove and right at my ankles and above my elbows, the 6 fit a bit more loose and below my ankles and right at my elbows. it is so different and easy to wear."
"This is a beautiful dress. the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture, and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful. the waist is very fitted but it didn't feel uncomfortable. i didn't think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned. i do think it is a bit short on the front (it is a high low dress), but at 5'4"" that is not a problem for me. it was true to size for me (135 lbs, 34c)."
"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.
and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back."
I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!
"Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short, i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed.
needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!"
These tailored front flowy back tops don't always work. this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering
I ordered this after falling in love with the near-identically-patterned red linen shirtdress - this dress has almost exactly the same construction, but the cloth is slightly heavier-weight, and there is no slip (because the fabric is thick enough to not need one). a few other reviewers mentioned that the cut was ill-fitting or unflattering - obviously, that depends on the wearer's build - this dress seems cut for relatively small-busted people, so i lucked out. i love the classic a-frame outlin
The models pose and description are misleading. this top has absolutely no shape to it. the front of the shirt is kind of like a slub shirt texture, plain black. the back print is nice,just more faded than shown in picture. the entire design has no form. it is huge. also cheaply made.
This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
"I bought this sweater on a whim in the store, without trying it on. when i got home, i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later, desperate for something to wear, i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.

this is a great sweater. layered with a cami, it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured, so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w"
Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top, i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.
I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.
"I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so, decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to ""cover up"" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently, but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!"
"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly, yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!"
This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.
"I'm 5'6"", 125 lbs, wear size 2 or 4 normally, and small or extra small. 34b bra. i tried on size 2 and it fit great. this dress rocks! i live the soft material and side pockets. not a lover of a line skirts, but this one is subtle. i do need a strapless bra, but if you are more endowed than me, you won't need it. the hem is unseamed, leaving it a bit edgy. since the denium is light i can wear ghis dress now and into summer. i live in texas so probabley won't be wearing it after june. covering my"
I ordered this online with out previously trying it on and it fit nicely! just love the colors, draping and material. nice and light, good spring or fall dress. i wore it with black flats but it would look great with booties too. very flattering. i received a ton of compliments!
"I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas. it doesn't look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and isn't too big or too tight anywhere. i am 5'6"" and 130 and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model. the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit. this is a winner! it can be worn casually or dressed up."
"Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"", 135 lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i"
"I bought this top in two colors because i need more statement tops and thought the colors were different enough for a really great top. i have only worn the ivory so far and love it. comfortable, great style and solid quality so the fringe isn't fraying or falling out.

if i could change one thing it would be the itchiness around the neck opening. it's not horrible but it can be distracting and mildly uncomfortable.

i am really happy with the tops and can't wait to start wearing the black one t"
"Very comfortable and soft. i wish the neck was a bit lower and it runs on the large side. i am 5'7"" wear a 10/12, i ordered the l and it was very big on me, will try it in the m, though i'm worried that it will be too high in the waist on me."
"I got the small; 5'7"" 150 lbs,pear shaped. fit was a little sung,mainly due to the lining.i wore it once already- super cute.i washed it in cold and line dried it as i was afraid of shrinkage.i thought about getting a medium but all sizes except xs are sold out. i must be careful not to gain any more weight,otherwise the dress won't fit me anymore!"
"This denim dress is best worn by someone over 5' 8"". i had to spend a lot to have it taken up and it still doesn't look that great. so if you don't want to pay over $200 once altered, do not buy this dress.

the best part of the dress is the top. it was true to size on top."
"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!"
"I need to start by saying i'm 5' 10"". i think that's why i love this dress so much. it's not too short on me like so many. it is a classic fit that is flattering on me. the raw edge detail makes it a little more fun then just a strapless denim dress and the pockets are the best! i love dresses with pockets! they don't stick out weird or anything either. the only negative which prevents the perfect 5 star review is the bottom is fuller than i would like. a-line is a little misleading. it's defini"
I'm 5'8, 130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.
These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.
The beaded shoulders make this a unique tee shirt. it turns an ordinary tee shirt into a more eye-catching one. i bought 2 different colors and love them. i prefer the little boxier fit as it is very flattering. the material is a nice weight, not too thin.
"I got these in the neutral color & quickly understood why they're categorized as ""loungewear"". if you're going to wear them out of the house, wear a tunic or a dress over them. i folded the scrunch part up over my calves & wore them like boot socks when i went out. i got a m/l & they fit about on par with other leggings / tights of that size range.

when i got home, i rolled them down & put the bottoms over my heels. the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles. i recommend them for around"
This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.
Beautiful flattering blouse
This has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee. it's perfect with jeans, a leather skirt or even lounge pants. it's a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because it's so versatile.
On the advice of other reviewers i purchased the m/l in this item. boy was i happy i did. i am normally a size 6-8 and because of the sheerness issue mentioned by another reviewer i purchased the larger size. they are still sheer in the rear end. you must wear a tunic or longer shirt/skirt with these. if you are hanging around the house it is not too bad. these are very comfortable and feel great while wearing. the color is great and the look is good. they are really long when you remove them fr
I love this shirt! it fits great and looks awesome with shorts or skinny jeans. i love the beads on the shoulders. i liked it so much that i ordered it in 2 colors.
I cannot even tell you how many pairs of white jeans i have tried on in my quest to find white jeans! all brands and all styles and finally i took a chance on these and have found the ones! these are great quality, as true for any ag pants i have ever purchased. they are a crisp white and are not see through and the fit is amazing! i have athletic legs and with my muscular thighs and calves it has been difficult to find a pair of white jeans that didn't hug to tightly and therefore fitting poorl
This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me, not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker, but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design, just not the right material or fit.
This top is very feminie, i love hte pelats and flower details. it can be, however, a bit boxy, i think if you have wider hips, i might avoid. great to go with skinny pants/ejans, though. could size down, if shoulders are not too wide...
They're great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn't have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job!
"I love these with tunics and little dresses! they hit at a funny place on my hips, though; i wish they were a bit higher-up. since the waistband is thick, they show through tops unless they are pulls up above my hips, and they're a bit too short-waisted for that. but i was able to stretch them a bit, and i love them!"
"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee. 
regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi"
"I'm normally an xl, but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body, but not tight-fitting, just as shown on the model.

the detailing at the shoulders is heavy, compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so, it pulls the neckline forward a bit. 

i bought the red and wow! it's a bright, fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled."
Absolutely love these leggings - warm, comfortable - great way to relax after a long day? snuggle up in these...do stretch even longer after a while, but wash and wear again is easy - even wear out of the house...bought in green and love how well they go with sweaters, shirts, etc. -
For the sale price, this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because, being on sale, that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders, and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later, i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers, but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true
"I slightly balked at the cost, but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product, and it is made in the usa. in these times, that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck, front and back and the slightly lengthened sides, very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing"", which is one extra step... still, i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium, my usual ( size"
Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse, i purchased this blouse. it's true to size, size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich, a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it, and of course, the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect, feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly
As in most ribbed camis, this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.
I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.
This is an adorable topper for all these ballgowns when you have no top. that said, it was a lot shorter on me than i expected. i attribute this to the fact that i have a chest. the fit is true to size, but while not showing much tightness around the chest to any gape in the buttons in the back, it became more of a crop top. i have been needing a short topper so i'm definitely keeping this. the back button detail is adorable. the lace for me is soft and not stratchy or irritating but i only trie
"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. 
why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo."
"While there are a countless number of ""winter-white wear-with everything"" sweaters, this is the best one i have seen yet. it is a substantial weight without being coat-like. it is cozy and can be crossed over in front to wrap if desired and it is not itchy as it is cotton. and it's hand washable! i would say it' runs true to size. i wear a 0-2 and petite ( 5 ft 2 in). i purchased the xs but not in petite becasue i wanted the length. it fits fine in the shoulders but the sleeves hit me at my knuc"
I bought this in the store so i didn't know that it was actually a sleep chemise. i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a super-short dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on. the price is shocking but i'm a teacher and this month (july) teachers get 15% off so that helped a little bit. when i tried it on, i absolutely loved it. maybe i look like a cupcake but i'm a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves! who doesn't love tassels?! this is just a ve
Another really cute iop (i tried on the blue), but if you are short, you definitely ned a petite size. sofy fabric, and pretty pattern, like hte tie nexk. too bad they sold out in my size...
"I tried the regular szie in store, like the cut, need petite though (too long and a lot of fabric) - i am 5'1.5"" and 115lbs... color, unfortunatly, looke aweful on my skin tone and washed me out. would need to be more red, the striping washed out the color nad dind't look flattering on me. the cut did, however.

so, if you ahge a good hur to your skin, good dress for you, if you are palelike me, i don't recommend...

ps love hte tie waist. picture not asflattering as on person."
I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!
This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a
I really loved the material and the feel of this item, however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.
"The shape is flattering on my postpartum body. even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest, the swing shape hides my stomach area. the material doesn't seem particularly breathable, so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot, humid weather; but for my summers in the pacific northwest, it'll be fine."
The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also, the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
"This dress is really gorgeous, really fun and beautifully made. i'm typically an 8petite (140lbs, 5'4"", 34dd) so i got this in an 8 and it was huge on me. there was so much extra room in the chest and the back and it was much too long for me. even if i sized down, it feels a little age inappropriate for me. i'm 21, and it felt very conservative and unflattering.  i think this dress is excellent, just not for me."
I adore this blouse. i bought it in the blue at my local store and ordered the white! so cute. be careful- i dried my blue one (i openly did not read the care instructions..haha) and it shrunk a little. still beautiful though!
I loved the look of the dress. it's a very flattering design. however, i absolutely hate the side zipper. every time i have worn it, the zipper will get stuck and it is a struggle to get it up. the side tie is a very cute touch, but you definitely have to figure out the best way to tie it, so you don't have a huge bump of fabric on your back. having said all this, i still did get a lot of compliments from this dress. i do wish the dress had a lining.
I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on, i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8, but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger, so unless you have really broad shoulders, you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place, and the little tie in the front is awesome, because not only is it an interesting detail, it can be loosened or tightened d
This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this, i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted, the bottom is very fluid).
They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously isn't the ideal fit but it will manage. it's very cute, but the colors aren't as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.
This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.
"Ok...so after reading the other reviews, i'm sad to say i rated this as ""runs small"" only because i usually buy one or two sizes smaller in maeve than i settled on with this dress. it's actually an adorable dress but i'm sure you have to have the right figure. i don't think any one woman has the same figure as another and this dress is made for someone with a very definite hourglass figure. i have a large chest, a moderate middle and large hips. i really loved both sizes but i chose to size up b"
I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..
Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.
I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places, too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b
I have to agree with another poster who was dissapointed about the dress not being lined....i mean, any dress over $50 should at least be lined! but, overall this is an adorable dress, very flattering and so fun for summer! if it were lined i would have purchased, but that's all personal preference as i cannot stand having to wear a slip!
"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. 


i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,"
I have been looking for a basic ivory sweater. i waited for this one to go on sale. the style is cute but the sweater itself is very stiff and heavy. unfortunately i decided to return it.
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!
This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute, but a little bit odd, it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.
I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always
Love everything about the top. it's very versatile wear by itself or with a cute jacket. it's a great staple to have in your closet.
This dress is the opitome of summer! day or night, running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite. i feel it runs small on the top, i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomier...i wear a size 10 on top and for referance i got the 12. i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomier....imhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my
I love the print on this. love. and the fit, for a swing blouse, was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true, but this one is so nice! i loved it so much, but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this, but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.
"This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3"", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!"
"I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately, xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee, but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable, hte weird part is the fabric, the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
The print and fabric are great, but this dress has odd construction, or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway, i'm 5-5, weigh 125-130, 36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo, but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped, but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress, i think a medium would make the top too big, so i
"This dress is very well-made, fully-lined, and overall quite beautiful. however, i will have to agree with the other reviewers who say that it runs small. i am typically a solid medium in retailer clothes (5'9"", 36b, 155 lbs., apple shaped, long torso), but the medium in this is skin. tight. not a good look. the large fit much better and i did not find the skirt to be like a pencil (the fit is like the picture) and the length is at the knee. anyway, interesting that there is a such a huge differen"
This sweater is super soft and comfortable. runs very big. i usually wear a large, i purchased a medium and it is almost too big.
Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape. price is great with extra 40% off so considering to get dark red one as well now!
I ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl. it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear. it also attracted so much lint. the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it. it added weight and was unflattering for my shape. the colors do match the photos online. the length also matches the model's photos. it just didn't work for me.
"Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well! this is my first pair of pants from retailer. i always have the ""too tight in the thighs"" and ""gaping at the waist"" issue but not with these at all. i was so surprised. i purchases size 26 in both tan and blue. the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable. a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway;)"
"I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and tried a small."
This dress fits comfortably with great fabric and feels sturdy without to much weight. i love the color. the fit would be flattering on many different body types. i would highly reccomend this dress.
I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality,very flattering, and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional, which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend, but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!
The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful, and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.
"This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.
it is a little roomy, but true to size. i love it that way. 
totally on trend for the season"
I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!
"This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4"" and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl"
"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however, on me, they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste, and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus, back they went. for reference, i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6."
I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i
You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference, i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed, and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.
"This dress is beautiful. i am happy i chose the sky blue color. i read a review before ordering that said it was more beautiful in person. it certainly is! i can't wait to wear it. the only issue is that it runs a tad bit too big. i am very thin, and usually an xs in retailer clothes. i could've fit an xxs. good thing the straps can tie and be adjusted. also, it is a little longer than i thought it would be on me (i am 5'7""). other than that, i love this dress."
My normal size 32 fit tts. the length is great (i'm 5'9). i love the button detail on the bottom, makes them a little unique.
I love this sweater. comfortable and flattering. great for going out causal and staying warm!
Just purchased it in store - very soft and cozy, great neutral color too. i am usually s, but bought it m just to have it slightly oversized.
I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit, because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami
This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking, that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck,
"As others have mentioned, they're quite long. i'm 5'8"" and need to wear 2"" heels to make sure these don't drag. they're much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles."
"I loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house, so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store. i anticipated that i would need a large, but i was wrong. the m fits perfectly! 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 in button-up or fitted tops,and dresses (usually 10) and a m in a loose-fit or knit top.
the m fits me just like the model in the photo, so i would think that you are between sizes like i usually am, you should size down. the z"
"I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!"
"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on.
after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""
 comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for 
many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!"
I'm always on the lookout for those special clothing items that add pizzazz to my wardrobe. this is one. i had been looking for a bomber jacket and tried many but this one falls elegantly and is really beautiful. i can't wait to show it off!
I ordered this after seeing the rave reviews. it is not for me. just like the culottes i ordered, this romper makes me feel like a grandma. i said i'd recommend to others bc of the other reviews but again, this was not for me. i also didn't like the back of the romper. no way i could even get away with a racerback bra b/c it's so low cut. the good though- it is super comfortable and is a nice heavy fabric. tts also. i'm a med 8/10 and the medium was correct in this.
"This has quickly become my favorite sweater. i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out! it's comfy-cozy and soft. love it layered over t-shirts or long sleeved collared shirts, and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once it's warmer out. it runs kind of big. i'm 5'8"" and usually a size 6/8 and i got an xs. the s fit too."
"I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted didn't suit me. i was shocked by how flattering it was, because on the hanger it was just ""meh"". the material is soft jersey, heathered, and it hangs well. it has a simple lining, but that doesn't interfere with the fit. it is a little low for my personal taste, so i wear a cami or scarf, but for those less well endowed, you'd probably be fine without one. for the record, i typically wear a 2-4, 125 pounds, 5'8, and 32 ddd br"
"This dress is fantastic! it's super flattering and very versatile. for reference, i am 5'4"" and 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 - 10 in retailer dresses. the size medium fit perfectly. highly recommend this item!"
I am excited for spring so i can wear this. i purchased the orange. it is actually more of a red, but i like it. colorful and flattering fit.
"I love the look of this dress & had high hopes, but it didn't live up to them. have no doubt that it is well made & beautiful, fully lined with lovely detailing around the neck. i am 5'6"", 155lbs with a postpartum belly that i'd like to hide, so i chose this dress as the reviews say it's a bit loose & forgiving. i found it to be so loose that it looks big & entirely hides my figure! i considered ordering a small, but knew that it was simply the cut of the dress & going down a size wouldn't chang"
I received this product and love the color and sheen of it. it is not too flashy, and would work great as a dress to an event day or night with the right accessories. i am about 5'7 and 115 lbs, and usually wear a size 0 in dresses. the size 0 fit, but was a little loose. if they had a 00 it probably would have been too small though. you definitely cannot bend over in this dress because it is too short, but i didn't feel it was inappropriately short otherwise. it flares out just slightly on the
This dress is so comfortable and looks so good. i love the low back and the swing in the skirt. i ordered the tangerine, which is really more red than orange. this is a simple, slip-on dress, perfect for traveling as it doesn't wrinkle. i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives.
"This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like, but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale, however! then they're all mine!)
this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o"
"Loved pattern,  quality and fine details on this dress but  it ran large. i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it.  i went bsck to order a petite x/small, but it was no longer available in this size on- line. so disappointed! 

fyi ,  i'm 5' , 112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress! 

this dress is comfortable , well made, lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a"
First of all a caveat, i am not curvy at all. i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such. specifically, i am 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 123 pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style. all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dresses/clothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such. if you are shaped like me, this dress will be perfect for you! it highlights your advantages (slim and petite) and give you curves (that i wish i had natural
"Sadly, i had to keep only a few dresses, not all of them, so that one is in my wish list if my xs petite goes on sale in red and blue, i am pal so that is hte better color for me. i have not seen the green in eprson, but the neutral color is very nice too, if you are not into red.

materila: thin-ish, strecthy, super comfortable, may be cool in a cold area though, brr.

fit: xs petite fit perfectly everywhere, surprisingly, the shoulders are capped sleeves, i dind't exepct having them ""fall'"
I finally visited a store with petite, and this dress was there, so of course, i snagged it to try on... i love the colors, i mean awesome, the fabric is also very soft, but the cut was just huh on me, nothing to go raving about,.,, i think it would be nice for a casual day but i often just wear joggers or yoga pants on casual days... so for the price i left it.
"I was concerned about purchasing this dress when i read about two slender people buying it. i'm 5'6"" 145lbs and athletic. i normally wear a 10 and i ordered a 10. the material is really pretty, but stiff, more like brocade. the cut is different and it's not form fitting or feature enhancing, but it's comfortable and looks attractive. the arms and neck are not binding or cutting, they are interesting touches that make this different from other shifts. it's lined, falls a bit above my knee but not"
Love this sweater! you can wear it with just about everything. i have worn it with dresses, leggings and jeans. you can dress it up or down. wonderful quality for the price.
"Purchased the blue motif colorway which (as other reviewers mentioned) is cream, mushroom, black (heavier lines) and very dark navy (grid part). looks good with both my cropped and duster-length black cardigan. print is a nice balance between neutral and interesting. a lighter weight knit but still opaque and skims over (versus clings to) the body

the fit is very flattering and forgiving. the rushed midsection is cut higher and lower on the side seam to give a more hourglass line. the scoop b"
"If you like the way this dress looks pictured, you'll love it when it arrives. the patterns and colors are vibrant, the fabric is of high-quality, and the dress is lined with a black slip. for sizing, i""m a size 2 or 4 and the xs is a great fit. while i often order petites for dresses - this petite was short enough on me to be mistaken for a tunic. (i'm 5'3)."
This is a great throw in your weekend bag summer dress. it runs a bit large, especially on the top, but i'll make it work. back is a bit low, so a cardigan would be required for office wear.
I wanted to love this dress, the open back, the lightweight fabric, and fun print. perfect for spring and summer. it could be i'm too tiny for this dress, but the front of the dress wasn't flattering. it just hung and there was an odd tuck in the waist that made it look like it ballooned out under my chest above my waist.
I purchased this in the green. nice print, not overwhelming. slips on, hides a bra, and was simply comfortable to wear. can easily be dressed up or down, but i was looking for a dress that i could slip on at the last minute to go out to dinner with friends. i took it on a trip to florida, and it did not wrinkle in my suitcase. what more can you ask for?
This dress is so flattering and comfortable. i got the green which is not too green. this is the perfect dress for a spring day and can be dressed up or dressed down.
"Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height. the description doesn't mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be 31 inches. the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy. great color and style. i may be 60 something but these jeans bring me back to my youth. love them."
I bought this dress because i thought it would look good on her, and it does.
To my knowledge this dress looks great on everyone. the fabric is light and of moderate quality, the finishing is acceptable. a great basic.
I got it in tangerine. beautiful, soft material, very flattering and cute dress. i am petite, so i will have to do some alterations to make the top port shorter, but other than that it's a perfect dress.
The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!
"I was so excited to order this dress; however, once it arrived, i realized that the fit doesn't work for me. i carry my weight in my stomach and backside, and the dress clung to my trouble areas."
After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand, i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights, clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.
In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un
This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years. the fact that it's machine washable was a huge plus. fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect! i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room, but either would have fit well.
"I saw this dress online and drove to the store to try it on. i love it! i bought the tangerine color which is really red and blue (not black). i am 5'7"", 130 pounds, 34b and i got the xs. the small was too loose in the upper portion and the arm holes were big, like another reviewer reported. i have a long torso and the dress fit perfectly. it's a lovely, soft fabric and i will take it traveling with me as it won't wrinkle (and it's washable).the back is cut low, but surprisingly my bra didn't sh"
"I am so glad i returned this dress for a size down. i am 5'10"", and 160 lbs (curvy and muscular build), and the medium was surprisingly much too large on me. i returned it for a small, and oh my, it is perfect. i plan on wearing this to two summer weddings this year, and will then wear it for work. it really is a go-anywhere-do-anything sort of dress."
I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them, the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy, on the other hand, was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no, it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28, hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or
This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress. it's really comfortable, true to size and the cut is flattering. you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals. i didn't want to take it off. sizing is straightforward on this one: just order your regular size. there's nothing tricky about sizing. the xxsp (my regular size, depicted here), was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description. great buy. waiting for boston weather to coope
This dress is flattering in so many ways. fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips. sizing is perfect. i also bought it in the navy/black color. you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops.
"I bought this dress in three different patterns, i love it so much! i am 5'7"" and around 135 pounds. usually a size six or eight in dresses. ordered the small and fits perfectly if a little bit. curvy frame. great for women on the busty side. fits beautiful and is stretchy but not too clingy."
"I'm a size xl and i'm busty, so my review might not apply to everyone.
.
i really wanted this jacket to work, however, it did not. i tried this jacket on in my usual size xl and it was nowhere near the correct size. this jacket runs small. i don't see how anyone with a bust is going to be able to button this jacket. the jacket is not lined and it is very fitted, so putting the jacket on and taking it off will require a very thin shirt to be worn underneath.
.
the style of the jacket is very"
"I've had this dress for a while now and waited to write a review, glad i did. i originally ordered the mp, 5'5"" 130 lbs. while it looked nice - accentuated my waist it was a bit big in the chest area. it probably would have been ok but i am picky about fit. after debating for awhile i ordered the sp and it fits much better! when i pulled it out of the package i was worried it was too short but it's not. it hits right above my knee. in fact i compared both dresses and there is not much of a diffe"
I love this jumpsuit. it's unique, comfortable and fits true to size. you can dress it up or down depending on the event. every time i wear it i get loads of compliments!
Super easy and cute. i received lots of compliments!
"I ordered this dress the instant it appeared online, hoping that 'tangerine' would mean red, and not orange. and, what luck! it was the perfect red for my coloring - nothing orange or bricky, it was a true red. the background color is actually a deep navy, but it looks almost black in some angles. the fabric is super comfortable. it's long enough for work, easy and fun enough for a date, and perfect for spring-summer months. 

my only problem with it is the top is too large. i am a 34-a, 5ft-3"
"It slips on easily, is soft & flattering. it will definitely be my ""go to"" dress."
"What i love especially about this dress are the comfortable, soft fabric and the shape of the back -- the scoop and longer back hem are very ballet dancer! the green & off white print is very pretty for spring. sizing is a little tricky for me as i'm between petite and regular sizes. the hem length in the sp is perfect, about 1.5"" above the knee in front, but the waist sits a little high. the top seam of the waist section is above my natural waist, and the bottom seam sits right under my navel s"
Beautiful dress!! i love this and am tempted to buy it in more colors. fits true to size, in a flattering way. love the cut of the back and the flow of the bottom.
Over all this is very cute . it is very short. but has very good quality material.
This dress is nicely made and hangs beautifully. i did find the shoulders a bit too wide even though i have pretty broad shoulders. then again, i'm also pretty tall and the length on this dress is really nice, so i'll take the slightly wide shoulders. the low back and gathered waist are very flattering. a perfect dress to wear in the summer!
Great dress, comfortable to wear and flattering, with the stretch cinch waist and the soft flare of the skirt i feel flirty and fun with its open scoop neck and dipping back. plenty of space and simplicity to accessorize or not. i bought it in black/white and red, each with its own feel.
"Love love love! i'm 5'8"", 122 lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2"" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y"
Didn't even wait for a sale on this top! so adorable and fits great. i bought a medium and wear a small in most things. i like that it is a touch big as it hangs better that way.
This top is so cute. a little cropped, light for a sweater tank in my opinion, and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit, the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!
On the picture shows the belt.doesn't come with the belt.
I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty, but as has been said, i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail, the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return, and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy, but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath, as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day
I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful, i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though, just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down.
I have worn this sweater many times, i have received great compliments!
"I ordered this in black and loved it so much, i ordered the 'red' color too. it hasn't arrived yet, but i'm hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5'3"" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and wasn't too long."
"I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8"" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue, which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss."
Very lovely sweater - lightweight with cute detailing at the side of the waist, sweet but not saccharine bow at the back of the neck. i really wanted to love this sweater, but it had to go back because it looked, um, used. pilling along the arms before i even got to wear it? it got returned, sadly.
I love this sweater. it is classic but has details that make it fresh and different. the tie in the back offers very interesting detail.
I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews, but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine, unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts, but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l, depending on the shirt (5'9, long torso, 36c
I ordered this shirt through the website hoping it would look like it did on the model, it does! very nice, thick fabric. fits true to size, no complaints at all.
Lovely holiday blouse, flows at the bottom but doesn't bell out like some tunic blouses. the arms aren't cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish. charming and romantic.
"Wasn't sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3"", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they don't show the squishy bits at all. it's a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i don't have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly"
This is cut very strangely, i'm short waisted and this barely covered my belly button. the material is rough and scratchy. did not like at all and will be returning.
Super comfortable while also being very flattering. i'm 5'7, 135 lbs and ordered a size small which fits perfectly. i get lots of complements on the color, which is as pictured. love these for yoga, climbing, and lounging.
"I really like this sweater. it is surprisingly warm. it is not very form fitting (which can slenderize), but i enjoy layering with a lacy tank and don't have to worry about sucking in the guy either ;). i'm 5' 8"" and typically wear between a 6-8, the medium was definitely baggy, i ended up with a small in 2 colors.!

oh, and the bow detail really does add a fanciness to an otherwise comfy/snuggle sweater."
I love this dress. it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering. i vary between a 4 and a 6 in dresses, and the 6 was too large on the bust but the 4 fit great! the dress is longer than in the picture, the model must be wearing heels, but it doesn't quite hit the ground with flats. the fabric is light and airy, it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well.
I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!
"I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it's a color you wouldn't normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i'm looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.
i'm a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit's snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin"
Very graceful, long skirt. runs true to size and looks great! this is the kind of dress you will wear all summer long.
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.
"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2, if not 0. 

the bust is probably a 34 a or b, or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well, but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it, so i will return it. 

the fabric, design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality."
"5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, 4 dress. ordered a small and a medium. never tried on the medium. the small was a little big in the waist, but what threw me for a loop was the chest. huge! could work if it's meant to be blousey, but the armholes were massive. if an xs is returned, i might give it a shot. but i can't imagine what women who are smaller than me are going to do in this jumpsuit. great color, transitions into fall easily. cannot be belted or wear a camisole due to the opening at the stomach. sh"
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.
if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer"
I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out

"Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only 3 stars. i love it, as i do all coth & stone pieces. and it is cloth & stonw as another reviewer pointed out. the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight. this dress does not run large as do some c&s pieces so don't size down. i'm 5'7"", 126 lbs and slender, and the m is perfect. if you have large or very muscular arms, this dress might not work for you. i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath, tights and boots"
I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately, it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause, i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together, so the minute you put it on, one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse, a mix of various floral swatches, is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!
I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!
The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style, but it was too tight.
"The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however, the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright, but would be a nice transition to fall top.
the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better."
I like this! the fabric is soft and a little less orange-looking than in the photo. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and the size l is very small on me - as in i'd have to lose a little weight for it to look normal on me. also, it's a bit annoying that you have to undo all the little buttons in the bodice to get it on and off when going to the bathroom. but otherwise it looks cute and even has pockets!
"The dress fit fine, with two exceptions. first, i am 5'1"", and i ordered a petite 4. the dress was dragging on the ground, so it would need hemming if i were keeping it. but the deal breaker was that the gathering of the outer fabric over the bust stuck out an inch beyond my 34d figure, which made me look like i had very oddly shaped nipples. i made the assumption that the dress i received was defective, so sent it back, but unfortunately, the replacement fit the same way. the lining fabric fit"
I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!
Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!
I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.
I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.
"Cute in concept, so large in reality. i am 5'3"", size 24 in jeans. i was swimming in these. i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long. don't even try if you are a little person. long and lean, yes, would probably look great on you."
I was able to try this on in store thanks to a return. it is a cool looking item and i thought the fit and aesthetic were spot on but the price made me leave it behind. even on sale, i this wasn't worth the price for me- the high-low hem and material combined exclude it as a work option for me. if this is something you can get mileage out of, i really do recommend it- well made, lovely colors, and nice style.
I have been wearing tankinis for a long time and haven't worn a one piece in years. i'm 40 and, let's be honest, things don't look the same in a bathing suit as they did 20 years ago. this suit is very flattering - i'm not obese, but i do have a bit of a jelly roll in the stomach area and the combination of the polka dots and the ruching, as well as the construction of the suit itself with the side panels, really camouflages my stomach area. although there isn't underwire, which i prefer, i do f
Comfy and different. almost like a sweater fabric.
I bought the 0p and love this skirt! it works well dressed up for a night out or i even wore it to my nieces baptism...have received a ton of compliments each time i've worn it.
I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.
So happy with this top. i love the fabric, the colors and the flowy fit!  definitely recommend!
I'm not much for ponchos, but this one looked unique. it is thin, kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online,, and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
"I am 5&#39;4, 125-130lbs, c34 bust. i ordered this dress for a wedding in size 2 and it was too big! exchanged for the size 0 and it fits perfectly. order 1 size down, ladies!"
"I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5""3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must."
This top is really pretty and flattering. i bought my usual size and its loose and flows without being too boxy. the pattern is beautiful and the band on the top stays up well.
Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo
"I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail. i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater. i feel the sizing is true-to-size but the design is not meant to be close to the body. for me, the shoulders and length were perfect.

this top is all about the sleeves. matador? perhaps, but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater. i will wear with with a vest, skinny jeans and booties."
"This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated, modern, and flattering. i was surprised that the ""dress"" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay, which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape, but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks, and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it."
This is a very nice, well made skirt but beware, it runs extremely large in size around the waist. i usually wear a m in most things, and i am going to return this skirt for an xs.
These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.
Love the fit....not so tight you can wear a short top with these, but not slouchy either. color goes with everything. for wrinkles, i hung them and sprayed with water...wrinkles gone. bought 2 pair for traveling.
These joggers are amazing! they fit true to size if not a bit loose. i purchased my usual small (size 6). the seams are sewn perfectly and the fabric is dreamy. i wore these to work with sandals and was so comfy and appropriate all day in the hot weather. the color is a deep gray and goes with everything! the front panel makes them a bit more fitted and there is even back pockets!
It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however, i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight, perhaps that might help with the fit?
"Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days."
I waited impatiently for this item to come in stock, and when it did, i had it overnighted because i was so excited to receive it. it's hit or miss with me as far as retailer's mediums and larges, depending on the brand. i generally err on the side of caution, so i ordered the large. it looked cute out of the package, but when i put it on i was terribly disappointed. it flared way out at the bottom, and was not as fitted through the waist as on the model. this could have been the large sizing, but
This is so flowing and perfect to hide any flaws.i adore it!
I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.
"I love the pattern adn color combo, but, wow,t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway, not for me, but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.

length was decent in regulat size though, not too long. just too wide."
"True to size if we take into account how some brands are making things bigger for hte size; i ordered both the xxs and xs, and xxs was more flattering (years past, xxs would be way too snug, my size didn't change). pros: i actually thought the cut was flattering on me, the top is very cute. hte bummer for me is the fabric, the grey part is not as sift as i would have hoped and the ""shirt"" part can wrinkle (did in the package). length was nice for both sizes, so overall, i would go smaller for a"
This is an adorable top, but it just wasn't my style. i'm 40 and felt silly wearing a big bow, but if you can rock this look i'd recommend it. the top is a thin sweatshirt material, not a knit sweater or a thick sweatshirt fabric. it is a cotton rayon blend. the sweatshirt part is cropped, but the striped shirt details come to a good length. the shirt trim is 100% cotton. the fit was true to size. it is a bit loose, not overly fitted, but true to size. it nips in a bit at the waist and then flar
As in the other review, this dress runs small. i'm usually an 8 but it was tight and short. i would love to exchange for a 10 but it's out of stock. the beading and the colors on this dress are breathtaking...i was so disappointed it didn't fit! the background is more taupe/nude than cream which i actually really like.
I love everything about this dress. the style, fit, colors and design of fabric, quality and feel of fabric. so happy and highly recommend!
"I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy, perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area ""winter"", but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt."
"This shirt is so soft and very flattering. i ordered the navy in a medium (5' 10"" 150 lbs). love how it scoops in the back."
I get nervous shopping online, but this top fit perfectly - wasn't too long or too short. it has nice flow and dresses up or down depending on the look you're going for. i got the off-white with blue polka-dots and love it!
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange, not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time."
"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft, love the flowiness, and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size)."
"This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small. 
i wish it came in different colors. i love the style."
This is such a cute design, but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big, it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.
Such a pretty blouse, drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side. i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times, but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine. maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didn't have the chance to try on another size. still love it!
"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color, very feminine without being over the top.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there, making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place, although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly"
I bought this in wine in both the small and medium. both fit but am keeping the medium since it drapes better and looks like the photo with longer length in body and sleeves. light material is a great weight since heavy sweaters can be too hot in heated offices. style can be dressed up or down for office or weekend. have ordered the blue and grey. only concern is how well the fabric will launder.
I love almost everything about these jeans.  color, fabric and rise are perfect.  unfortunately, they bag at the knee on me.  should have ordered a size smaller than my usual, but since i have worn them, i will keep them.
Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !
What a delight of a dress! i saw it online and it piqued my interest in person too. with only one size available, i was limited to try on a dress two sizes too small, so i've factored that in to my review. the dress is very light and would be see through without the attached slip. the length fell just above my ankle with the design allowing for a movement and flow to the bottom. the colors are vibrant in person, perhaps even more so than online. the fit seems to be true to size, though i have to
I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.
Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work, but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.
Loved this blouse but tried on size 8 (my size). waaaaaay too big. tried a 6 - still big - but the 4 was perfect. the only problem was that it did get a bit shorter in length but also ended up a little more fitted which i really liked.
This shirt was exactly what i was looking for. it's fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing. some of retailer's shirts can have too much swing for me, but this is just right. the color is great too!
"I agree with other reviews; this shirt is more like a thin sweater. it is so soft. i was walking around the first time i wore it asking people to pet me. i just got it on sale and wore it twice this week already. i've gotten so many compliments. i bought this on sale in grey. i love it so much that i just bought a navy and burgundy one too. it runs slightly large, but i like my comfortable sweaters to fit large. definitely an important staple to any wardrobe."
A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size 4 was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well, the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy, & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the 4 didn't). i went w/ the siz
This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!
Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.
I was hesitant to order these especially because they didn't have a petite since there's shipping and i thought i might have to return them. i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big (i'm usually a 4 but in retailer bottoms 0-2). i ordered the 2 regular since there were no petites. they're not too high waisted (i think they could have gone higher) but they're not low, either. love them. they're so fun and i can't wait to break them out.
I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!
I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.
I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!
The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit, they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.
Hi quality fabric and detail. fit really well. i'm 5.4, 120 and they will be a staple of my summer wardrobe.
I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it's very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust
I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!
This is the first thing i saw when i walked into retailer and immediately snagged it. it is so flattering and true to size. pretty colors, unusual styling. there is nothing about this beauty that i don't like!
"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1"", so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!"
I love the tie dye and the accent stitching. back detail is fun!
This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.
I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.
"The tank is very structured, thick yet breathable, not see through. the coral is much brighter in person, and the white is more like a light cream color. the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because it's such an unusual color. size regular xs is fitted on me (not too tight, not too loose, but over the course of the day, it stretches a little) and the hem falls at the upper hip (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big. the knit a"
"I saw this skirt at my local retailer store and thought it was just another corduroy skirt until i got up close and personal. it feels so soft yet there is structure to the skirt, hurray for a bit of spandex for movement. the first button is different from the rest of the buttons and i appreciate that type of details. only the wine color was available in the store and it is shown just like on the photo. the skirt falls right above my knees and size regular 4 fit me very well (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 3"
I like this top. it fits nicely. the knit is thicker than i though it would be t but i still like it.
I purchased this tank in white. the material is very soft, but it is very thick, which i was surprised by, but i still like it. the fit is a little boxy. i have an xxsp and it fits a little large. hangs perfectly - just like the photo. i almost sent it back just because of the boxy look, but i think i make it work this summer. going to keep it!
I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco
"Light weight and cotton, great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me, but they are not falling down so far. also, if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black, you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer."
"Great pants, with a couple of quibbles.

these pants have mini blue stripes in the fabric, so in real life they look a bit more blue than they do in the photos. these are not white pants, but they would fill the ""faded blue denim"" niche in your wardrobe. and also like faded blue denim, these pants are more opaque than most lightweight white pants are these days. you would not want to wear black underwear with these, but likewise your undergarment choice would not be immediately apparent (compa"
"I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately, even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall, it's a cute dress but just not for me."
"Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it. 

keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the"
"The material is horrible, it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning."
The material is different than i expected, but i like it a lot. the dress is extremely tight fitting, i will be returning it if i can't figure something out. i'm a 36d and wear a 6, very very restricting in the chest/shoulder area. unfortunately, it may just not be designed for my body type. getting the dress on was for sure one of my hardest workouts...and i crossfit. oh, and the bow does not come off at all, so good luck with that. the red color is gorgeous, i hope it works out.
"Love this tank! i ordered a small and it fits beautifully. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. . tank is sheer so i wear a cami underneath. length is quite long but i wear it with skinny white capris and it looks chic. my only concern is the raw hem edge. worried about how this will hold up with some washings. other than that i love it. i received many compliments when i wore it."
As soon as i saw this dress, i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it, i noticed it was slightly small, but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it, but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one, but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton, making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6, i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area, making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a
Even though this shirt is incredibly thin, i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup, with white jeans in the summer, over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!
I was hoping to wear this dress for an engagement photoshoot but it fit terribly. i'm 5'0, 98 lbs, 32a, and have some hips/butt. this dress (ordered xxs petite) hugged my hip/butt region tightly, which made the dress ride up and balloon out around my stomach and back. there was also too much extra room in the chest, so sizing up was out of the question. there is just way too much fabric and it's very stiff with no drape or shape whatsoever. i felt like i was wearing a cardboard box. the sleeves
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.
This is a very comfortable bralette- the silk covers one's most sensitive parts, so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing. it's very pretty, too. i wear a 34b bra and the small fits me. it doesn't have a lot of support, but it's very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands. the cups are a little far apart, but it still works. if you're looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear, i would recommend this at the sale price.
This has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like. however, the color is not orange as advertised. it's more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for. i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind.
I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally, the bow did not cover my bra strap, likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.
This dress is adorable but sadly not for me. i had to size up from my normal 6/8 to a 10 regular to make sure all my curves fit in comfortably. sadly i wasn't in love. the bow back hit me right to cover my bra but the fact mine didn't come with pockets as shown was a disappointment. it will be going back.
Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric, but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper, there's room to go small if between sizes, be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel
I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!
"I found this to be true to size (m fit me well - 5'7"", 140 lb, usually a size m for tops). it does have a straight fit, and it hits at the waist. i wouldn't call it cropped, but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer. it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath, and you can pull the shirt's cuffs over the sweatshirt. the sleeves were a great length."
So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!
"I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big
i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.
when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.
however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.
either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand."
"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma"
I received this dress as a birthday gift and am completely in love with it! there are some things about it that i wish i'd known (but are by no means deal breakers!). first, you can kind of see this in the model shot, the keyhole neckline is not sewn shut at all - it's completely open. it didn't cause problems for me, but some women may not be comfortable with that. my dress didn't have any zippers and so was a pullover. the band that runs around the waist has little to no stretch, so you have t
I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
"Love this top, but the xs is still way too big, swallows me. 5'1"" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly, had to return this item."
I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,
This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual! wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both! lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care!
The cheshire dress is lovely. the fit is true to size and the quality is awesome. i love the way the sleeves lay on my shoulders. i would definitely recommend this dress!
"I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.

unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.

i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale."
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
"Love, love, love this dress. you can dress it up with high heels, or down with sandals . a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining . i am athletic , 5' 7"" and 132 lbs and bought a size small. i have broad shoulders , average waist , short torso , small hips and long legs. in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress."
I can't stop wearing this. it's perfect for layering! the fit is great-loose but not a bag. i love that it's a wide open knit.
"I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same, not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted, generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom, peplum""ish"" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.
"There was only a l in store but i tried it as a gauge. given i am normally a xs/0, i knew it was going to be too big but wanted to see if i could get an idea of how it might look in my regular size. it truly is a lovely blouse - gauzy fabric, flowy feel and an easy piece to dress up or down. however the xs was much shorter in the sleeves, (above the wrist bone on me), and much shorter in the body, (sat at mid pelvis - for ref i am 5'7""). this completely altered the look and i think i would have"
I ordered this in xxs petite, and it fit nicely, the green color was nice, the cut was just above the knee, flattering, but not wow. it is nice if you need a casual dress to hang around, go to the beach, playground with kids, etc., but there were just better options for me. so i returned it. the size fit me well at 115 lbs, 30dd chest. i say go for it, if you need a nice soft casual dress, ok to size down.
I bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it!! it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust. it is also a great length, hits about an inch or two above the knee. highly recommend!!!
I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years. finally. i got the gray/navy. soft, warm and classic. i expect it to last forever. it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fall/early spring in minnesota. the sleeves are long, but push up nicely, and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse. i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers, and it is very polished for work. soft. but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy. i agree that it is a little boxy--but i t
I love these jeans . i have a few pairs of citizen jeans and like the way they fit . these are a slim boyfriend jean - not too baggy - very flattering with any top - loose or tight fitting . wish retailer carried the white .
I bought this top last week and absolutely love it! it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places. it does not cling, but is very flattering for my size 12-14 body.
The colors of this top are perfect for spring, i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning, is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this, as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
"The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes."
I recommend zooming in on the fabric as there are like ink streaks on it which at first i thought was a flaw but it is clearly shown--and is actually a nice touch to make these different!  the fit is true to size or a tiny bit small if you are curvy in the hips.  i wear a 10-12 and the l is fine but i wouldn't want them any smaller.  super lightweight the piping detail on the sides is really cute!
Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i'm not. going back.
Alright, so i really love this shirt. but i am having it taken in to fit me. i weigh 110 and am 5 foot 3 and pretty petite, and this shirt is too big on me and i got an xs. i didn't wanna get xxs and am glad i didn't because i think it would be too short. i'm going to keep the shirt, but it is too big on me, it puffs out in the front and some in the back when you stand certain ways and i need to have it taken in, or else it isn't as flattering as it should be. the material is awesome and i love
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly.
This shirt fits beautifully, though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft, and the look classic and feminine.
I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice, soft and flows well. the fit is good, i ordered 30, could have gone with 29, not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there, too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit, which is a disappointment when you pay so muc
"The color of this top is perfect for summer, it is a light lilac tone. the fabric is also light and super soft. great cut too - even my husband liked the cut of the shirt. 

i ordered a large based on other reviews but found the arms to be a little tight, but not enough not to keep the top. the shirt does run slim, being a 36d i do have to keep the top buttons unbutton but i am okay with wearing a little cami under the shirt."
Right on trend, easy to wear, but a bit snug in waist. which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier.
So soft and comfortable!
"This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.

same fabric as my other cloth and stone items, however, i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also, the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way, which i like."
Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und
I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me, retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted, and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative, it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso, and doe
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small"
"I've had my eye on this poncho for weeks and finally scored the olive green one over thanksgiving/black friday special. i would say the color is more mustard yellow, which will go well with a variety of jewel-tone tops, etc. the poncho is a nice weight, but not too heavy. i am 4""11 with short arms, but i went ahead and bought the regular xs instead of the petite sizes and the length is perfect. i am seriously considering getting the cranberry one as well. a classic buy for winter which i'm sure"
"This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters, so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium, so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6""). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral, but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!"
Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work, with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape, with the large wing like sleeves, makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold, you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though, i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won't be don't a ton of moving aro
Love this top-that simple
"Originally got one with a stain. retailer quickly sent a replacement,
useful with many skirts and pants. well made."
Colors are great, the fit is flattering, but as soon as you raise your arms, the whole shirt lifts... there is no picture of anyone lifting their arms... be sure to wear something under :-)
I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn, and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans, or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
"Retailer, please make these fantastically versatile chinos in tall sizes again! i am 5'11"" and i usually order a size 8. the regular fit hits in the wrong place at the knee and results in the back of the knee fitting and feeling uncomfortable."
"These trousers arrived today. yippee. i really wanted to love them. i do like the color and the cut. not crazy about the fold-over waist. the fit through the waist, hips, and thighs is true to size. the biggest issue is that the description states that the inseam is 31.5"" which is perfect for me. however, these pants are actually 33.5"" in the inseam which makes heels a necessity if i want to wear them without altering them. i rarely wear heels these days, so that does not make me happy. one leg"
I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.
I love the feel and quality of these pants, however, they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist, unfortunately.
Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size, they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.
"Great, lightweight pants for summer!!! size down the length is slightly long and they stretch out throughout the day. i'm 5'8"" normally a 33 in pilcro and took a large in these. so cute"
"I'm 5'2.5"" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it."
"Super cute. 5'9"" 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much."
I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia, where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool, out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!
"This is the perfect sweater for early spring; lightweight; but not too thin. i""m 5'2"", 125 lbs. the medium fits perfect."
"I ordered this only because it was in the stylist's picks, and decided to see what it was about. i ordered a petite, and don't regret it. the petite on my 5'1.5"" falls right by te hips, which is more flattering for a bomber-style top #not sure if descriptions says that, but it is a bit bomber-style#. the color is truly ivory, not as white as hte picture depicts, though now that i look colsely, you do see a contrast with the white top the model is wearing #so don't expect very white#. as mentione"
This runs a little big and falls off the shoulders a bit. i didn't like it as much as i had hoped.
I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them, they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them! (i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose). my local store was willing to offer me an exchange. kudos to retailer's wonderful customer service and standing by their products! i actually wear mine un-cuffed with boots and it looks super cute.
I love the dress enough to go on a diet. i sized up but still have reservations about the integrity of the seams if i should sit at any point during its wear. i hate skin tight clothing, and wear a 0 in everything else - the 2 made me feel as if you could see my cervix. i own other byron lars dresses that fit in a 0 - something happened with this dress.
For me, this top ran true to size. i'm so glad i ordered it in my normal size, because the spandex would have made the top way too clingy for me. i am normally a 8/medium on top and 12 bottom. i ordered this in a medium, and do not find it large at all. if you are going for a fitted look, sizing down may be best, but i didn't want it tight. on me, it's a little looser than what is shown on the model, but it still fits very nice, and not sloppy. i am not a fan of baggy tops. i have no issues with
This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape, so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i can't wait to wear this.
"Normally a 28, and on a fluke i dragged the 27 to the fitting room. the 27 hung better that the 28.

i have a belly, but not much in the hips, so this was surprising. most things are too tight in the waist.

denim feels very soft. they may not last, but it's like butter."
The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!
This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs.
"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline."
I found this dress on sale recently in store and it was in my size- a 2p! i tried it on and it fits perfectly for my 34 d and 5ft frame. since i found it in store and it is an older dress, there are some frays in the threading (probably from being shipped, handled, etc). i still bought it for the sale price. i look forward to wearing it out!
I love these jeans! another winner in the pilcro line. i took a size 29. i normally wear a 30/31 depending on cut. i am 5'4 inches and about 150 lbs curvy with small waist and the 29 fits comfortably and very flattering to my figure. love the button front and the red details . i recall having jeans like these about 15 years ago and this cut is so perfect , cute and stylish. the regular length hit just slighting above the center of my foot so wearing with flats will be perfect, i am not a high he
I tried these jeans on in my regular size and they seemed way too big, but still kinda cute. i went one size down and suddenly they were the most adorable, comfortable jeans that i've every had (and i have a lot of jeans!). i love them! they are very soft with gorgeous fading around the pockets. they are button fly which is unique. i got them on the sale on sale price and they are well worth every bit and more. i plan on wearing them with boots although high heal shoes should be beautiful with t
I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.
I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6, not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.
Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting, but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.
I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
This dress!!!! i had to try it on. of course i fell in love with it. it is so gorgeous in person, like a piece of unique artwork. you'll never find a dress like this!
Order at least one size down or the double v neckline will insist on slipping off your shoulders. everything else about this top is great.
This is my new favorite sweater. it is a great mid-weight sweater, that hangs beautifully with an interesting bottom hemline. im so happy with this purchase. im 5-9, 155# and the m is perfect.
It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.
I liked the look of the tunic sweater, and it was very soft. i am 5'7, 115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight, but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings, and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft, but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
I really like this jumpsuit, it is long waisted on me so i hope that washing it helped. love the material and washed up nicely. should be really comfortable.
A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.
Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants, jeans, or something dressier.
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.
This dress is amazing. i have it in almost every color. it is incredibly comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down. love it!
I've been eyeing this dress for some time and it finally went on sale so i decided to buy it. i bought a size small and while it fits through the shoulders (which is the place i need a little more room) the body of the dress needs to be less sack-like for lack of a better term. i thought it would hide flaws, but unfortunately, it makes me look bigger than i am. it kind of bags out even at the back where the fabric is gathered under the yoke. that being said, i don't really want to return it beca
This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.
I purchased this sweater after i saw it on a salesclerk at my local retailer store. i am usually a xs but based on reviews decided to size up considering the description of the fit of arms. when it arrived it was overall ok but seemed boxy at sides so i exchanged for my usual size. it arrived today and fits great-less fabric along sides but still good length for my 5'8, slender frame. the arms and shoulders are not too snug. the colors are beautiful and it is out of the ordinary-a statement piece,
"So soft, warm, and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews, and while it fits, it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/2 in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul"
I'm a little hesitant about the dropped-hem style but this drapes so well and looks utterly chic. i wore it to a poetry reading with some fluevogs and it not only looked good but it felt like i was wearing nothing. the material is beautifully soft and i love this particular shade of blue. will definitely be wearing this a lot.
What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily, hugs all the right places and skims the others, feels like pajamas, and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120, 5'-1', 32 dd, usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small, and could have gone with either, but the petite had better proportions, especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi
Saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming plane ride. originally ordered the teal color, but when it arrived, i was disappointed that it was more of a muddy greenish teal and not the light bluish teal like in the photo. exchanged it for the black version and i couldn't be happier. the black goes well with everything--looks great with jeans and yoga pants. love it!!
"First i think this dress runs a bit large - i am 5'5"" and about 140, athletic build. i tried on a l, m, s and ended up keeping the small. it is also a bit longer than i'd like, hits me in the mid-knee in the back hem, and barely above my knee on the front hem, not mid-thigh like on the tall model. i probably would have preferred a petite size but they were sold out. anyhow i decided to keep this dress because it is super comfortable but still stylish enough to wear to work. the slightly fitted a"
"I love this dress! i was apprehensive about it at first, because of the light material and boxy style. turns out the material is very flattering, and it hangs very well. the style isn't as boxy as it seems. it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesn't fit like a tent. i am 5'4"" and i ordered the petite. it's short enough to show off you legs, but not too short. for being less fitting, i like the balance of the short length, and it looks great with heeled boo"
This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
"I'm 5'5"" and about 115, 35-36"" hip and small bust - the xxs petite is a nice fit, and doesn't hang straight down as it does on the model. it has some shape around my hips, and the slit is slightly above my knee, overall legnth also shorter than shown (good). it's not colorfast when you receive it, so be careful wearing light colored underwear (and maybe wash with only very dark colors the first time or two). i tried a regular xs in store at first, and it fit more like the photos - more of a beac"
I saw this dress on the girl working the fitting room at my local store. she had it knotted in the front with some cute cognac sandals. i immediately fell in love! i tried on the xs, my normal size, and it fit like a dream. so comfortable!! it was a little pricey so i held off but couldn't stop thinking about it. i went back the next day, caved & purchased. it's one of my favorite dresses for summer now. i love this brand so i wasn't surprised!
"Love the detail of this top; however, it runs large and had no shape on me"
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
This top does sit weird, feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down, probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.
"I'm 5'10"", approximate size of model pictured, however this dress is at least 3 in shorter on me. the fabric is a bit thin and the v-neck is quite deep...
but i happily wore it on the beaches of puerto rico, added a jean jacket and epice scarf and wore it in paris. last week i wore it  belted ( as i saw a sales associate in antro do) with an open weave sweater and flip-flops on a warm boston day. don't count it out yet, it really is a chameleon piece that you can wear so many ways."
Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.
"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!"
"I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7"" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice"
"I received this jumpsuit today in size medium. i am normally a size 4-6. overall, the jumpsuit fit. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and the length was fine if i wore flats. the issue with this jumpsuit is the bottom half. the top jersey wrap part fit great--nice and stretchy, fit nicely on the curves. the problem is that the wrap part stops at your rib cage and the pants begin somewhere way up high, definitely on the rib cage. the gathering of the pants gave me a pooch where i don't have one, but the deal kil"
"Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2"" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"", 125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal."
This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size (not petite). i am 5'1 and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees. i can wear it to work without leggings. the other thing i love is it has pockets! and it fits generously - i weigh 140 lbs and will usually fit in a medium (if i don't breathe) and a large (if i use a belt). but in this size (medium regular - i can breathe! and i need a belt. ergo - i don't feel like i need to
The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.
"Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium, the torso length is a bit short, making the garment pull. i sized up to a large, and with room in the hips and the correct torso length, the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference, i am 5'7"", 36a, 155lb."
Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out, or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality, not itchy.
No complaints about this top. i like that it's very soft and the length is good as a tunic. would recommend.
"This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso, but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion, though, so not sure if its just me and my complex.
if you don't have a short torso,then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.

overall, i am not sure who this was designed for.. but"
Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.
"I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put ""true to size"" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight, as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi"
This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it, the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
This skirt is shimmery without being too much. rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous.
"These jeans are extremely soft to the rich, as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan."
"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for, but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models, but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans, but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f
I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer, and would work in an office. but, on me, the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad, the couldnt have done it better. further, the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again, not flattering
I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.the reader outfits next to the listing were darling. i do not care for the model shot. i think the dress is true to size and well constructed.
"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available, i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide"
"This skirt is a real ""dress up"" piece. it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist. the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely. i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments"
I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.
This skirt is a dream. so so beautiful. looks way cute with brown boots. give this a go. don't listen to any negative review. this skirt is perfection.
I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.
"I don't know how this dress looks on your monitor. on mine - it looks dark green. which it is! i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as ""slate."" that aside, it was a bit too large on me, and since i am on the shorter side at 5'4"", i looked a bit like a child's doll in it. i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful, and so is the quality."
"Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs."
I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!
I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy, but made extremely well and on sale a great price!
This was an unexpected surprise. i love the material of this short sleeved (almost sweatshirt) summer tee. the entire design reads late summer stripes with a cozy twist! the first time i wore it made me realize how tricky it can be to wear stripes and this design deconstructs all my previous hangups!
I love this!! great quality and super cozy. perfect to throw on for casual summer nights.
This is a great quality product with unique design
I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size
I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.
This is definitely my go to top for work, weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans, black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo.
Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee.
I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore, so i bought 27r, knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better, and it fits a tad loose ev
This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!
These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short, i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight, i probable should have ordered then one size up!
This is the most intricate, delicate, beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue, coppery brown, and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin, dark hair, and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug, especially on my hips, and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give, so i would say with any curves, size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!
Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.
"Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.

they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo"
I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging
I am in love with this tunic, i wear it with everything, jeans, leggings and just tights! super comfy, quality design. runs a bit large but i like that.
Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.
I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.
Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.
It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.
"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length."
I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!
These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans.
"Definitely a great silhouette. overall, it's just a really classic look that can hang around in your closet for years before it looks dated. that said, it runs small. i often have difficulty with clothing like this since i'm a 4-6 on the top and a 10-12 on the bottom (5'7"" --- 35"" 28"" 41""!!!). my booty is definitely pushing some limits in this dress, but it does fit wearing a 6. shapewear to the rescue. conversely, my shoulders are petite, so the shoulders are a bit large. try this dress on in m"
"I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go"
I love this tunic in the carbon color on the model. the color does look different in person, more of a lighter gray. on me, the tunic runs very large. i am usually a small or medium but took the extra small in this and still have room. i agree with the other reviewers about the pockets. they do add bulk in the hip area so if this is a problem area for you, i'd avoid this tunic. overall, it's a nice tunic for everyday wear. the tie-neck adds a nice detail and makes the tunic stand out. it looks g
"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy, so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available, but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence, go for it. totally worth it.."
Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.
And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.
"I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it.
i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner."
This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!
I really like this jacket! it runs big, so you may want to size down. the fabric was softer than i was expecting, but i really like it. very cute fall jacket!
"When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s"
I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.
This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.
This dress needs such a specific body type but that's not to say it isn't for everyone. this dress is lovely but it's a dress that you need to try on in multiple sizes to figure out which will fit. i tried this in three different sizes to find the fit it was supposed to be. i had to size up and go to petite size. i do vary between 6 and 8 and this one i ended up getting an 8p. this dress is lovely but it is a trial and error dress so don't get discouraged if you have to size up it will look love
This sweater does have a matching tie belt. it is detached, no belt loops. i'm guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material. i loved this sweater on line. i could not bring myself to order it at full price. with tax it would have cost over $200, seemed too pricey for a sweater. when it was marked down to $99 with free shipping i couldn't hit buy fast enough. i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out. my disappointment was the color. it is fa
I ordered an xs regular and it barely skims the floor when i'm wearing wedges or heels - perfect! it's form fitting but not clingy, and i think it's a pretty, comfortable dress. glad i made the purchase!
I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews, but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering, making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
"Cool, comfortable, goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available, but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty, and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black, darker than pictured online, imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had, because it is such a great piece, but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10"" 145 p"
Agree with the positive reviews. this fits nicely with my casual lifestyle. i ordered an xl in the grey although i generally wear a large. it's a bit oversized with plenty of room for layering. it does bulge a bit in the back but the knit waistband still hits just below my waist. the only drawback is that the sleeves are a bit wide, long and loose at the wrist. it's lined in the body with a soft fleece. the sleeves aren't lined but have a soft silky fabric in the cuffs so easily rolled, adding i
This dress is really simple and elegant and i want to love it but i'm having a hard time getting it to fit right. i'm normally a size 4/6 and i bought this in an 8 and couldn't zip it up. i'm a 36d which is part of the problem so i exchanged it for a 10 and i can now zip it but the bar in the back i thought would cover my bra strap but like other reviewers mentioned its a bit high. most of my bras fall right into the hole beneath the bar. its unfortunate because i wanted to love this dress. i mi
I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.
This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shape,it is true to size, i am 5'3 and 125b the 2 petite fit perfectly. the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette. it's the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy. this dress is so figure flattering, i could not believe how many complements i've received on it.
This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.
This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.

2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.

3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.

4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.

5. the underarms bunched funny.

6. the dress has h"
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos, but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.

3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all."
"I love this dress, it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim, just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)

i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go."
I am a huge pilcro fan. however, these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!
The dress is beautiful, i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully, and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.
Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!
Like the other reviewers, i opted for the grey version. almost every tunic dress i've tried winds up looking like a sack when it's on my body, so i was very pleased when this dress looked pretty great. the neckline is perfect - nice depth and addition of on-trend lacing - and the length (love the shirttail hemline) is also perfect. the drape of the material keeps it from looking like a shapeless bag. my only comment #and it's quite minor - i'd give this 4.5 stars if i could) is that the pockets
"This skirt fits me like a glove, you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit high
fashion fun chic. i am 5' 8"" and 145 full figured and imlove this out fit. very cozy too."
The dress is well made with a great material. it is extremely long and unless you are tall it would overpower many petite women. i returned it.
I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough
I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.
What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!
"I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active."
I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
Pretty detail, fits nicely. i feel it runs very tts. it's a lot, though. fuzzy and detailed. it definitely takes over the outfit. i wonder about shedding as well if you pair it with dark pants or jeans...? it would be gorgeous with simple winter white pants at a holiday event. still on the fence, i don't know if its for me.
I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.
Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans.
This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate, yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured, there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs, which is my typical size in retailer sweaters, as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize, but not bulky.  however, the decorations do add some volume, so maybe not for all body types.
Noce color as well, only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality (it was pink and i tried on the grey). otherwise, nice and soft. regular size a little long and long sleeves, but sold out n petite :-(
This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.
"I expected to love this, since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine, but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back, unfortunately."
"Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch. 

fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!"
Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.
Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
The details on this dress were pretty, but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that, but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
"I bought these stretchy skinny cords in my usual size 28 (31 waist, 33 low waist, 38.5 hip/butt).  they are comfortable and long enough for my 5' 9"" frame.  i hope they don't shrink.  the flower pattern on all the pairs in the store has the flowers running down the inside and outside of my legs.  the dark part runs down the middle.  i wish it was like the picture on the model, with the print running right down the front and backs of the legs, dark parts on inner and outer thigh."
This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich, luxurious fabric, a deep neckline, and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and, while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers, for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!
I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
"These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1"" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight, just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length , hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however, if i were any heavier, i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin, in most cases i would size up."
Very interesting material.  the very subtle/light window pane pattern is perfect.
This is an easy-going weekend piece. it wrinkles a bit easily but it's comfy and swingy. i was a little confused about how to wear the shirt due to the open lace pattern (nude bra or nude cami?) i'm still not sure if it's appropriate to wear without a cami
I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h
"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!"
"Classic dress with a twist with split colors. very comfortable without looking like a bag on. can be dressed up or down. i am 5'7"" 118 and bought th extra small. perfect fit for me. not form fitting but still has shape and style."
I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability
This is a cute dress, not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material. little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie.
This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it.
I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!
This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull
"I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly."
"I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf."
I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!
This dress looks very good on me! it's a cute way to appear dressy without the extra work to look the part.
"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality."
Very flattering fit. a little billowy but i'm okay with that because it hides my stomach. have to wear a camisole underneath as you can see through the lacey parts. overall i love the shirt design, fabric and fit.
"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l"
I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest.
Great top, cuter in person with details than looks in picture. i found it to be true to size though i was worried it might be too boxy and wide. it was great, very cute! i do mostly plan on tucking it in with skirts.
Love, love, love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice, however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops.
"The comfort of this fabric is terrific. the swing-y style is easy to wear. however, i expected a black and white dress, which is how it looked on line. in person, the light portion of the dress is a marled oatmeal color. it is fine - just not what i expected.

if you are a fan of swing dresses, this is a great, casual choice."
I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of
You must have this vest for your fall/winter wardrobe. the design is extremely flattering to the female curves. i love the feminine ruffles. the pockets are a bonus. the vest is vegan-friendly. a hundred percent polyester! i normally wear a medium, but the small size fits me better. as an artist, i like to wear with my red plaid retailer shirt. hurry and get this vest before they are sold out. i'm sick i missed out on the museum district vest. all the smalls were sold out. i hope my experie
"Love these pants . very flattering and comfortable and cool. perfect for the hot summer days.

they have washed well. need ironing. the charcoal ran a little bigger and too long but the hot dryer shrank them . the orange were perfect, still a little longish so i cold wash them and hang to dry to keep from shrinking

5.5' size 8"
"So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!"
"These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow!

i also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out!

they run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on."
"Love this top and the fit is very true to size. i am 5'3 and 144 and ordered a medium. the fabric weight is just right and not see through, the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tent-like too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out. wish there were more color choices to order from. it was touted as red motif but i would call it more red-orange. i cannot wear orange but it is ""red-enough"" to pull off on my skin tone with the white background. the sleeves"
I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors
Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down, they seemed too floppy.
Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!
I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.
"I bough a green, size s (140lbs., 34b, 5'8). the sweater is true to size: it hits at my low hip and, although it is cut generously, it is cut close to the body. the ""green"" color is very pretty and true to the monitor depiction of a bright turquoise. the material is very soft and definitely high-quality cashmere with no itch factor. however, the knit of the yarn is very chunky, which means that this is not a slimming garment. moreover, since i have long arms, the bell sleeves do not reach my wri"
I just received this in the mail today, it is very cute however it will be going back, if you look at the picture of the back it look like there is only one opening however below the knot there is another opening,
"This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i""m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!"
I love how soft, and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.
Loved the version of this loc top that retailer carried two years ago (or was it three?). was thrilled to see what looked like the same top and was called the same name ... but it's just not the same. length is too short, body is too wide, and even the fabric seems to be lower quality. disappointing, but i still bought more than one color.
These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs).
What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.
I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we
"It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants, and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet, so i can't comment on durability, but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear, and these pants are very flattering and slimming, and don't pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly, and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost"
The cut of this top is cute. it's a great basic t with a little flare. it's pretty pricey given that the fabric is so thin.
This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to
"""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.
.
""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it's a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.

in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre"
I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.
"Lovely pants, incredibly comfy fabric, but too short for 5'11'' people. stated inseam of 31.5 is a bit understated, but it is clearly not 34"" that i need. had to take it back to the store."
I love this top!! very comfortable. wear it alone or under a sweater. i have the black also.
"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.
just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!
it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!
the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!
the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!
beautiful and flattering fit.
it is a 10 !!!!
i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig"
Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially
The other reviews stated this was a shapeless top, but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute! the green is a bright, gorgeous jewel tone. it has an overall flowy, bohemian look to it.......the bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho! overall, i am very pleased with this top... it will be a great transitional piece into fall!
I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.
I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose, yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available, too. i would definitely buy again!
"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)
i am around 5'6"" and a little on the broad side, so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari"
I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.
"If you're a girl with no junk in the trunk buy these pants! they make you look like you are working with something! i love them. i am 5'3"" and always struggle to find pants that aren't too long and that will help me not look like an ironing board. these are great. not too long in regular and like another reviewer said, you'll have a booty. great lightweight pants."
Conceptually, this top is great. love the design and the bright crisp color and most of all the cut outs. the material is a little stiff but can see it softening up a bit with a wash or two. it does run very small. i am 145 pounds, 5'6: with a full 34c bust and a curvy hourglass figure 34, 28, 41. while it fits everywhere else, the bust is really small. i wear a size 6 but had to go up to a size 10. the size 8 fit but the chest would only close without a bra. so, i had to go up 2 sizes.. so when
I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still
"This top may be right for some, but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however, it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl, but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big. 

the quality is great and style so pretty, though. i wish it had worked for me!"
"These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!
love them"
"I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!"
I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!
J brand is by far the best premium denim line retailer sells! the fit on these jeans is amazing..worth every penny..also, considering it is a crop jean - warm weather wear - the denim weight is light and not too thick...the color is different from ordinary regular denim blue..lighter wash for spring/summer!
Quality, length, size, design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person, but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool, but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours, still great when taken out. thin, but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!
This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.
I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier, i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
"I usually follow the boho look, and this dress appealed to me immediately and it was in the color i wanted black. so excited to receive this as i knew i could wear it both as a dress and a tunic but that was not to be.
the outfit consists of 2 elements: a tight fitting slip that fits awkwardly and does not give enough room in the bust nor waist areas, and an overlay dress that is really quite pretty. but it too was too tight across the bust area which made the entire upper torso ill fitting.
i n"
"I really liked these cords. i ordered both colors. they are very lush corduroy material and the color is very rich. since i am short, i wear them as ankle length (i am 5'1""). my only issue is that they run very large. i am normally a 25-26 and the 25 was still a bit large. unfortunately, they are all sold out of size 24 :("
"I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!"
"Our store only had one petite dress in my size in stock. i'm 5'4"" and so can sometimes pull of petite sizing. no in this case. it was a tunic on me. however the dress fit beautifully everywhere else and the quality was beautiful so i'll probably order my size in regular to give it a try."
This swimsuit is beautiful. the quality is excellent. controls without being too thick. the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous. i am curvy , 34dd and the top fit perfect. good bottom coverage. very happy with this purchase.
Not sure who named this dress, but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric, with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes, leather flip flops, and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!
"I love this cardigan, it is very soft, and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite, however. added this one to my wish list :-)

soft, versatile."
Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :(
Nice work dress. flirty style for spring.
"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame."
"I couldn't wait to get this dress from the online order. the fabric looked so interesting to me - linen, appliqu, pockets, raw neckline. the dress looks sort of straight up and down on the model but in my opinion it's like a little a line tent. the top runs very narrow and i could barely get it over my head. i'm going to return it and try for a medium, for reference i am 5'4""  135 and usually wear a six or a small."
"This is a lovely, well-made piece by maeve, a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle, colors are vibrant, and design of the dress is cute, if a bit on the short side.

however, i, like some of the other reviewers, didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with"
These pants pair well with anything - dress up or down, boots or sandals....but beware, they run big and rear end stretches out when sitting at work all day. if you have a booty these pants will be perfect buy one size down tho. if you have a flat rear like me, then buy two sizes down. length is good to leave uncured, just above ankle or roll up to perfect height. great color - fabric is amazing.
I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!
"I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me, it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in ""person"" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots, which is a nice subtle touch. i put ""runs small"" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy, it is nice and soft. i"
"This is a pretty basic black dress with a swingy silhouette. the slip that comes with it is much tighter than the dress. the transparent sleeves and open-work details help it look a bit airier even though the shape is loose. the neckline has a flattering v-opening. i was able to try on a petite size at my local store (i suppose it was a returned item). the petite was still a bit long for me; it did not hit me above the knee but rather at or slightly below the knee. the dress was cute and comfort"
I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.
Great quality. very versatile design and super cute. runs small - i ordered up a size which was perfect.
I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c
"I was too late to find my size in petite. boo. i tried the regular sizing and it was huge...a total tent. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i tried an xs. it was gigantic to say the least. huge everywhere. i love that the fabric is thick but yet doesn't feel heavy or hot. i think it would be the perfect summer dress...could wear casually or dress it up. don't need a slip (what a plus for a white dress!) i definitely needed a petite size and most likely from the size of the xs a pxxs. really? i know i have w"
I bought this dress to wear to one of the upcoming events leading up to my wedding in mexico. it's the perfect mix of casual yet refined. as another reviewer mentioned, it is a bit tight through the bust, but luckily i wasn't blessed in that area. i would caution that there is absolutely no stretch to this dress. it's a true, straight shift. i'm going to rock it with turquoise and flats in mexico.
I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they
I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
"The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on, i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise."
Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.
"I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8"", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som"
These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!
This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however, the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for
Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!
This is a cute, fun addition to my wardrobe, especially since i am a polka dot fan! it is alittle short for me and i think it runs just a bit small, particularly if you want to wear like the model with longer shirt under it. overall, it was worth the sale price and will look good with casual pants, jeans and with dressier black pants for work.
Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.
"The overall color of this dress is more buttery white and the pale golden embroidery almost blends in.therefore i think the dress benefits from being styled . i tried bold colored scarves with fringes and big statement jewelry. this dress is more casual with its fringes , the jeans like material ( although softer than cotton) as well as the loose pullover style. it is easy to dress down with a blue jean jacket, casual sandals or even sneakers. 
i have a 38 c chest and the l fits almost too loos"
I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl
"I really like this dress but after looking at the photo, it doesn't look like this, well at least on me. granted, i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason, but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this, a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life. 

another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru"
I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red,for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it,if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
"I love this top. the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight - perfect for summer. i feel it runs a size large. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs, with broad shoulders. i usually wear a medium, but a small fit perfectly."
Cozy, soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.
This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.
"Sizing is just getting unreasonable, and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model, but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame, the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally, the shirt looked like it shrunk in length, and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"
I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s
I bought a size xl in the white with brighter small florals. i paid full-price as a splurge for summer. the details on the top are just as nice in person as shown in the photos. it's a sweet top. i love the upper portion. however, it runs long. i need to belt it/tuck it or it looks strangely like a long-tunic. the floral material is slippery and a little heavy. not the softest but it's washed well. i love the mix of laces at the top. it's pretty. not worth full-price but on sale, it's worth tryi
"If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig"
Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty.
This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..
"I have been looking for a cute raincoat forever. they are usually ""just a raincoat"". when this raincoat arrived - i was happy to finally have something that was fun to wear. only issue is a little tightness across the shoulder area - hoping this will just slightly stretch over time. the rest of the raincoat fit perfect and i wouldn't go up a size because of the shoulder issue. i purchased a light pink tie belt to use with it so i can keep the front closed when it is raining. it looks really cute"
This is a nice basic solid top with the extra appeal of textured detail around the shoulders and back. the v-neck is flattering. this top can work with many different outfits. i only wish my store carried the petite length, as the regular was too long for me.
Well, it's the snails that really make this cardigan special. the buttons and the open work stitching are nice too, and the fabric is soft and warm. a note on the sizing though - the style runs short in the torso and long on sleeves. so if you are petite like me and considering buying the regular size because the petite is sold out - you'll be fine with the torso length but will have to roll or scrunch up the sleeves. that's not too bad because the fabric is soft and easy to push up at the sleev
"Love these pants! thank you retailer for making ""tall"" really tall! i am 6 feet and have to wear heals keep the pants from dragging- love it! i got the black- not 'shear.' they run just a tad small. i am a 4/6 in pants and the 6t just fit me. 
i wear with a tank for casual, beach look; colorful silk top for a dressier look- very versatile. 

i just may have to buy this in the green. (i would get the white, but some reviews say they are pretty shear."
Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!
I love this shirt. i wore it once and it is so cute on - the problem came from washing. i washed once and made sure i washed on gentle. i took it out of the washer and hung it to dry and noticed that there was now a tiny hole in the body of the shirt. i am planning to exchange this and hoping it doesn't happen again!
I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.
This is a fantastic sweater--really soft, great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer, and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose), but when my arms are lifted out to either side, it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one.
This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug, but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over, anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise, the top is great and perfect for summer.
I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top, or down with a slouchy sweater and boots, or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise, as i am short waisted, and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering, and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no
The material is soft and the length is great. you can wear it with short or skinny jeans. the only drawback is the color because it is so light. it is pastel so if you like pastels it will be great for you.
"I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.

on the other hand, the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
"Beautiful medium weight duster; it looks just like on line photos!
my store did not have this duster so i ordered on line. i usually wear a medium top, but sometimes a large.
i'm 5'7"", 140 lbs, and i don't like my tops tight.
i ordered this duster in xl because i like room in my cardigans; i could have gone with a large.
i have to roll up the cuffs of the sleeves, but i like to do that anyway.
this sweater duster is soooo soft and warm! so comfy! very stretchy with no closures on the front."
I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo
I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the
Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!
For starters, the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top, but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top, the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.
Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.
"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well"
"I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad. 

 i love the style., the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me) 

now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the ""red"" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re"
"I just got this top in store today. all the colors were ""heathered "", pretty casual colors. the top is extremely soft and i would say true to size. love the flutter sleeves that give nice feminine details.  i hope it doesn't shrink in the wash and wears well! also, i found that the purple color seemed to run slightly smaller than the others? kind of odd, but i thought worth mentioning:)"
"It was a little on the thinner side (fabric), a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back, i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable, and the back is beautiful (love bows), tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price, even on sale, i didn't feel i absolutely needed it, but if you are looking for a hite tank, it is pretty cute. (ivory, not pure white).

xs: 115 lbs, 60 dd."
As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...
"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small."
I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz
Great style and cut, love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts, unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.
This dress fit me like a glove and it's very pretty on, but the fabric looks and feels very cheap in person. it didn't look like a dress i spent this much money on. the lining is a very silky thick polyester that doesn't seem like it would be comfortable in any sort of heat. the lace overlay has this strange fusing kind of material between the pattern that looks so cheap. i love the idea of this dress, but it just isn't worth the money (in my opinion) so i returned it.
This dress is perfection and i bought the blue one. please make this in black or other dark colors.
"This sweater is beautiful!
the lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozy.....rare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same time!
the lace is very high quality, and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated way.....adding that little something special.
the color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any age.
runs true to size."
I purchased the sand color (beige/) one size up from my usual xs to allow for extra room around the hips. the dress fit a little large so the extra room wasn't necessary. the fabric was much thinner than i expected for the price point. the dress was sheer and on my lighter skin tone looked more like a lab coat than a dress. this may be stunning on someone a bit taller. at 5'4 it just hung on my frame and didn't do much for me. the pockets are a nice touch but overall the cut was unflattering and
This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day, and a complete stranger complimented me on it.
I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color, and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
"This shirt dress will make a great piece for the summer to throw on. the length is perfect for either a dress or throw on some tights as a shirt. i bought the beige color one and it's a little see through. would def need to wear a slip on.

i am 5'8 120 pounds and the xs fit perfectly."
I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it's great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!
"Since these are high waist pants, i think the size given is more for a lower waist measurement where most pants these days typically sit. i'm 5'10"", 150 lbs and ordered a size 31 but it was much too large. i love the style of these pants a lot. they look great if you have long legs, the size 31 ran about 5"" above my ankle, higher than is shown in the photos but it looks great."
"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer, i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4"", usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
I bought this in a medium at the store (usually a size 8 -10) and bought one for my daughter who was with me ,in the coral color. (she's 7 months pregnant , and bought her a small. it fits fine below the belly. she loves how comfy it is.) my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well. :>) so, we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in. i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well. i did see that a
This is the perfect top. it is adorable, and the fit and cut of it is forgiving.
I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.
"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts, or the cut of this was not right for me, but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
Although it was a bit of a battle with my bra straps, it was completely worth it for date night. hot shirt! very comfy and quality fabric. next time, i may just pin or tape my straps...
"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly. 

reference 115 lbs 30dd and 26.5 on waist."
"I ordered the xxs p, but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well, it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist)
beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice, but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath, i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral, not red."
I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but, the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side, above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on, there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.
I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p
This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.
This dress is absolutely gorgeous. every time i wear it, people just don't stop admiring it. great material and great fit.
I purchased this dress in the blue version. its a lovely dress that would be perfect for summer. the dress fit tts on me .. it is a little low in the neck area and it is a little uncomfortable in the torso area. i am on the fence about keeping it. the skirt is flouncy, cute and fun. i hope i can get it to work
"Beautiful color; however, the fabric did not work for me. tight on top, large on bottom."
Love, love this top. fabric is nice and soft, looks great with leggings. love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back.
"5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif"
"Love the skirt, colors are nice, fabric is thick enough to go to fall, but not too thick for summer (ti is short, so has room). the colors are somewhat ""brighter"" in person, but not summer bright, more fall bright, not sure htat makes sense). love the flower pattern, it is pretty but strong at the same time.

now on to fit: the waist is the small part. my usual 0 was snug on the waist, but the skirt was perfect everywhere else. not sure about sizing up yet, as it may flare out too much, will g"
I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.
Online this dress looks so perfect, but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering, at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves, and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but, sadly, it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt, so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit, but the skirt still has too much fabric, making my hips look large. so much potential, but missed the mark for me.
I ordered a size 6 and an 8 based on the review that said that the piece ran small. i fit both skirts but chose the size 8 as it was a bit looser at the hip and the length was better. funny though-the pockets on both skirts were sewn at very uneven areas on both. neither skirt had usable pockets as they were sewn shut at half inch intervals on one skirt (6), and very uneven intervals on the other (8). i liked the idea of pockets which is one reason i ordered it-it is described as having side poc
It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.
"I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!"
"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline, because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas, the adorable print, the handy bra-strap holders, and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb, small up top, not especially curvy but not straight either, and i ordered my usual 2p. yup, the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way"
"This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an"
These are the best tights! last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband. this year the best waistband tights are best!
This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat
I loved this dress when i saw it online, perfect for a summer wedding, but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely, it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly, it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
First off, this shirt is a hd in paris brand, not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.
"Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish, i didn't feel this way at all. i'm a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling :) here's my thoughts:
-------------------------
pros:
- very soft with good amount of stretch.
- tulle bottom is exactly as pictured. i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe; it is not. this is pink/nude shade all the way.
- runs tts. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 5'9"" and found the medium to be"
I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.
I tried this on, left, went back, put it on hold, then finally took the plunge. i had a hard time justifying the price. not really a functional coat, too warm to be a shirt. but so unique, i had to have it!! i got the s/m. boxy, in a good way. got it yesterday with the antro members 20% off.
I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh
I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.
I adore this top. lovely color, fit is very flattering. can dress up for work with a skirt, or down with jeans.
I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.
Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.
I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!
Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!
This top is perfectly feminine. the fabric is light and the bow adds that perfect touch of distinction.
Got the blue & white striped in xs. fits perfectly. the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit. it's very comfy and good quality fabric.
"So much prettier in person than online. the animal print isn't in your face, but subtle enough for almost any occasion. the button-up collar and slightly past knee length make it work for a casual work environment. the pleats and airiness of the dress remind me of kate middleton in anita dongre. 

fit: 5'4"", 140 pounds - i bought a six, but the four would probably work as well. because of the lightness of the fabric, the extra fabric doesn't overwhelm my small frame. goes slightly past my knee"
This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play, can't wait to pair with booties into fall.
I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.
"This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3"" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy, but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!"
I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get
Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
I a looking forward to wearing this dress with a jean or leather jacket. the dress is well made and the fringe adds a nice detail to the otherwise basic design. be sure to order a couple of sizes smaller than your regular size because the dress is huge. i ordered the dress in both colors and am keeping the blue.
"As previously mentioned, this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly, and the small was the right size for my frame, but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped, and i found the shoulders to be large, the neck a bit too high, and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4"", 140-ish, and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller, it could've worked. i so wanted to love this, because it's soft and comfortable and cute, but back it goes."
I wanted the blight yellow as photo with navy flower motifs. however it was much more darker as on the tag, mustard. if you like its color you will like it.
Very nice sweater, surprisingly just as pictured color-wise, i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders, but this sweater flair out to the bottom, you can kind of see it in the photo, the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit, the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the
I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on, and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top, cropped jeans, and sandals.
"I'm 5.5"", 128 lbs, 34b cup, slender throughout, size 2 fit perfectly. lightweight, flattering dress. bought on sale to wear next year to baby/bridal shower type event."
"I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations, weddings, romantic dinners, tropical va cations....heck, i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would"
This sweater works on many levels for petite frames. the length is just right, hitting at the lower waist. the design is very pretty, feminine and with flair.
This sweater was unflattering me, very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off, however this one went back.
Absolutely love the print and quality is great too! unfortunately, for a well endowed woman like myself, it runs terribly small in the bust and hip region. it absolutely does not look as flowy on an hourglass body type. too bad because it's beautiful! might try sizing up but doubt it will work :(
I wanted this top since the first time i saw it. it fits perfectly in a small, as i usually wear a small or medium. it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top -i am a 36a- as it is not generously sized. it flares at the bottom, which looks quite flattering. the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style. i will wash it carefully, as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing. this is a beautiful top, and i am considering buying another in a different color. i think
I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed, but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft, not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through! (a must for me!) i ordered th
Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back
I ordered the red in xs petite, xxs and xxs petite (in case petite was too short). so far, the xs petite and xxs petite were shipped to me, however, thought the bag said petite, the actual dresses inside were regular sizes, and they were huge, even the xxs (i put it on on top of another knit dress and it was big0. so i reordered, this time only the xxs petite (though i am technically waiting for the xxs regular)... perhaps all the bags have been switched... we shall see, but perhaps this isn't t
I love the pattern, but the color was not great on my skin tone. i tried on the regular size and it wasn't great. teh cut could work, but overall, i didn't feel like it was enough for me to order the petite to see, and i sometimes do. in a tall darker toned person, this would be gorgeous. what i like the most is the color pattern in the print, and shimmer.
Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable, the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece
Buy these, they are a keeper. sturdy fabric, not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy, soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors, hoping that black will be available.
These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d
"This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!

otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un"
I ordered this dress in navy for fall, and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small, and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy, making it more modest, but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower
I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!
I ordered the ivory in size xl. it fit a little on the small side. the knit was good quality as was the lace. unfortunately, the mock neck was stiff and uncomfortable. the sleeves were a little too long for me as well so i returned it. but, it's such a unique style and good quality.
It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.
It's stunning in person. delicate beading detail on bodice isn't visible in the photo but really dresses it up. fits lovely but runs small. i am usually a 6 or 8, ordered the 8 and it just fits. fully lined. bought it to attend a wedding and i'm very pleased with it.
"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
I've been looking for comfortable pants for the summer.  this pants is the answer.  it's comfortable, thin, and yet not to sheer.  this pants a bit loose, i could fit in s.  i usually buy size 8 or 10 for shorts from retailer, so i'll say this pants run big.  the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy.  i found tiny holes on 2 other pairs before i bought mine.
I bought this is in the gray color, although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said, and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it, giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.
"This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.

tts. 5'7"" 127 lbs 34b wearing this in size small"
Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.
"Don't wait. get this dress now before it disappears. it is gorgeous, it is well made. it is like butter. the fit is perfect and the workmanship is stunning. everything about this screams, ""lets go party!."" oh yeah... and the skirt part kind of swishes around as you dance. you cannot get more charming than this."
Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
"I ordered the small and it fits ok,i probably could have went with an xs but i am keeping the dress.it is a very beautiful dress.this dress can be worn for casual or dressed up for evening.very versatile dress and well made.i did get it on sale which made it very affordable. i am only 5'3"" and the length in the regular s is fine for me."
I am 5'8 and 220lbs (extremely muscular) i ordered a size large and it hangs very nicely over my curves, the neckline looks pretty good with my broad shoulder, and the dress comes about 4 inches above my knee. i think people with curves would really like this dress but it does lack shape so beware if you're looking for something with some structure. the blue is gorgeous and the fringe details are very cute. this dress does seem to run a bit big.
This is a gorgeous sweater! i purchased it in black and purple.
I was looking for something business casual when i ran into this dress in store. i was able to wear a petite small, but am normally a 4-6 in dresses. it does run large! its perfect with heels for work or dressed down with boots in the fall. it is very comfortable and still looks like you're trying.
"I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he"
"This is a great dress - nice soft fabric and the red is a nice, vibrant tomato red color.  i ordered a small - i am 5'4"" and usually wear a 4 in dressed.  this dress was so huge - it might be mismarked but labeled a small.  i will have to return it - not even my seamstress can make it fit!"
"Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be, as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave, flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2"" 115 # straight frame. not too long"
Fun socks you will want to show off. design is printed on a relatively thin (trouser sock).
I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).
Wore this & got many compliments. true to size, elegant.
"These pants are really great! the fabric is soft, but substantial, and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey, almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. and purchased the small."
I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.
"I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long, lean, and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m, but ordered a l. it still fits snug, so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape, as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer."
Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!
Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.
These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are
This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides, it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!
I liked the simple styling of these jeans when i saw them in the store. the price is right considering what some jeans cost today. unfortunately, these are made in china. that bummed me out. they run a tad bit small but in the end i think they are more true to size because they give especially in the waist. the higher waist is a nice change. it's nice to be able to skip a belt. the denim is a bit rough after air drying so i hope it softens up.
"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!"
"This dress has a beautiful fabric, i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering, absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p, i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however, the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves, but on me, it was not flattering at all.
I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!
What a great purchase! love this vest. i live in pa and i see myself wearing this sweater for 3 seasons, which i love. great details, length, and knit. true to size
This is a beautiful dress. i ordered a size 10 to accommodate my bust (36d) which it did but the rest of the dress was too big. it was bulky in the middle area and did nothing for my shape. this would likely work best for smaller ladies.
"To start: i'm 135 lbs, 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress -- amazing skirt for an outstanding price! incredibly lightweight; has a stretchy-jersey lining. to fit high-waisted like the model, go down 1-2 sizes. in work slacks, i wear a size 6 or 8. however, my natural waist is small. i tried on the size 2 and the size 4. i purchased the size 2, although i still wish there was a size 0 to try on. a larger size will fit lower at the waist and will bring the midi length to ankle length."
This wash fits differently than other pilcro jean leggings. the rise is higher and the fit is larger/bulkier through the waist and hips. i love pilcro legging jeans, so the fit difference is kind of disappointing. i recommend trying this wash on first to see if you need a smaller size. i got the same size i always get in this style and this wash is definitely not as flattering as other pairs i own.
"Bought this dress on sale - i haven't decided if i'm going to keep it yet or not, because i'm not sure if it's flattering to my bubble butt. i normally wear a 6-8 in retailer (5'6"" 135 lbs thin limbs 38-26-38). i ordered this dress in a size 4 regular and i find the length perfect with flats or with heels. i also find the bust area, waist and hips accommodating without being tight, which usually never happens. for this current sale price, this is a gorgeous dress made with beautiful material."
I tried this on when i saw it hanging in the dressing room. i was pleasantly surprised by this piece. the color is beautiful - not too yellow - not too brown. i have not worn it yet so i'm assuming it will hold up pretty well considering my other pieces from this designer are still looking good with several wears. i bought this in a small size so it does not hang down like it does on the model. perhaps that's why i don't need a cami underneath.
"I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#, 34d, 5'4"" and the s fit well."
Overall very pretty.
I love this robe and can't wait to wear it while i'm getting ready for my upcoming wedding. the only con that i can see is that the sleeves are a bit baggy, but other than that it's perfect!
I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.
The print and style we're great! unfortunately, my bust unbuttons the top. there's no way i can wear this, even if i sized up.
Love this sweater. i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath. it lays nicely.
"These joggers are so comfortable. nice and lightweight and fabric is very soft and a bit stretchy, so they move with you. beautiful dark navy/indigo print, very subtle and blends well with many tops. perfect length (i am 5'3"", 116 lb. and purchased xs). love them!"
This skirt is a perfect statement piece that will work fancy cocktails and social events. it is a full skirt but not too overwhelming. perfect with a slim fitting black bodysuit. i sized up a bit and ordered an 8. waist fits well and length works with slight heel. quality is great. design is beautiful without being too much.
This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.
Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.
If you can get over the fact that this skirt feels (and looks awfully similar to) the exact same fabric your drugstore halloween costumes had when you were a little kid... then, it's surprisingly fun to wear.
I can't say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers.   it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love
"Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style."
I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough, unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well, rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut, great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!
I love the design of this and the pattern! it's comfy but a bit too much side boob for actually swimming. i like a bit more coverage, the front has great coverage but on the side... whoa!!!
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.
I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.
A little treat for me. i work from home and am sick of all my boring tops. this is a comfy little updo number.
These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size, but seem to stretch, so buy a size down. trust me, it will work.
As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top, the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece.
"I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however, the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them, and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve."
I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband, but i love them. they feel wonderful, yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.
This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.
This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back..
I'm 5'8, 130 and a small fits nice. these are different with the silky fabric, pattern and piping - busy but still classy. it is hard to match with a shirt as you need a shorter top so you don't lose too much of the pant's unique design.
